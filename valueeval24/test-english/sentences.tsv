EN_002	1	Spain’s minister pleads for ‘millions and millions’ of immigrants
EN_002	2	Madrid.
EN_002	3	“The demographic trajectories are there.
EN_002	4	It will happen, we will not escape it…” It is with these words that the Spanish Minister for Social Security, Inclusion and Migration spoke about the future of his country.
EN_002	5	José Luis Escriva elaborated on the need for migrants, reported French public radio, FranceInfo.
EN_002	6	The minister detailed his plans during the OECD Forum on Migration: “We will need 8 or 9 million people just to keep our active population at the same level.”
EN_002	7	The Spanish economy will therefore require “millions and millions of migrants in coming years” if it wants to remain at its current level.
EN_002	8	With 47 million inhabitants, the demography of Spain is worrying, according to the minister.
EN_002	9	His statements were similar to those of Jean-Paul Delevoye, the former retirement commissioner who declared at the end of November that “European demography and its aging population needed 50 million people from a foreign population” in order “to balance the active population by Europe in 2050”.
EN_002	10	Is it a necessity?
EN_002	11	It would seem so, according to José Luis Escriva who believes that, if his country wants to maintain an equivalent level of comfort, this necessarily involves migrants.
EN_002	12	“Our population will be more mixed,” he added.
EN_002	13	“We must prepare societies for this,” he said.
EN_002	14	He pleaded for the better “education” of future generations on this issue.
EN_002	15	However, the subject of immigration remains a major problem in Europe, with 2,5 million entries in the EU in 2019, including 150 000 illegal arrivals.
EN_002	16	“It’s a problem, we have to deal with irregular arrivals much better,” conceded Ylva Johansson, the European Commissioner for Migration.
EN_002	17	This is also the reason why there is a lack of European confidence on the issue.
EN_002	18	“European citizens want to welcome migrants in need of international protection and want to welcome people who will contribute to our economy, but they are worried that we cannot manage migration, that we cannot control it,” added the commissioner.
EN_002	19	However, for those who have the right to stay, “they are welcome, we must welcome them,” insisted Ylva Johansson.
EN_008	1	"WEF Attendee Liz Truss Says British Economy ""Needs A Reset"" As Market Conditions Worsen"
EN_008	2	New British PM Elizabeth Truss has been touted by many including the mainstream media as a “far-right” politician with wide appeal to British conservatives.
EN_008	3	This is fast becoming a prerequisite ideological position to take in Europe as the open border/socialist policies of leftist political leaders are leaving the EU in economic ruins and as they approach an energy based catastrophe not seen since WWII.
EN_008	4	Boris Johnson revealed himself to be nowhere near as conservative as many initially believed with his support of draconian covid mandates, stopping just short of enforcing vaccine passports but still requiring proof of vaccination for major venues.
EN_008	5	All this while holding lavish parties at his official residence during the lockdowns he helped enforce.
EN_008	6	Adding to the problem were Johnson's tax increases in the midst of an inflationary crisis, which led to widespread public discontent and his eventual resignation.
EN_008	7	When Truss became a potential candidate to replace Johnson some in the alternative media warned that her ongoing associations with the World Economic Forum and attendance at Davos events might be a red flag of another political pretender playing at being conservative while actually serving the interests of globalist institutions.
EN_008	8	This was, of course, called conspiracy theory by “fact checkers” in the MSM.
EN_008	9	It is a concrete reality that the new PM has been a participant in the Davos meetings held by the World Economic Forum, a central hub of globalism that acts as a think tank and propaganda mill where new narratives are born.
EN_008	10	Specifically, the WEF is most known for its “Great Reset” mantra, which is part of founder Klaus Schwab's “4th Industrial Revolution” concept.
EN_008	11	A key focus of the Great Reset is something called the “Shared Economy,” which is described as the complete erasure of private property and the implementation of communist-like governance over individual economic participation.
EN_008	12	The Shared Economy is the source of the phrase “You will own nothing and be happy,” which actually comes from an article written by the WEF and published by Forbes Magazine titled 'Welcome To 2030: I Own Nothing, Have No Privacy And Life Has Never Been Better.'
EN_008	13	Far from being a “conspiracy theory,” the Great Reset is commonly presented by the WEF as the ultimate end game – An agenda, not just an idea.
EN_008	14	This has rightly caused concern among the public, because many WEF concepts that are presented at Davos end up being adopted by major governments and instituted into law.
EN_008	15	And, many Davos attendees tend to climb the political ladder rather quickly into positions of significant power.
EN_008	16	Any legitimate conservative leader or candidate would therefore know about globalist terminology such are the term “Reset” and try to avoid using it at all costs.
EN_008	17	No right wing leader would want to be associated with a globalist agenda that the majority of conservatives would rather go to war against.
EN_008	18	It could be taken as a limited gaff or mistake, but Truss' recent use of the term raises eyebrows considering her past affiliations with the WEF.
EN_021	1	House prices rose by just 1% in 2019
EN_021	2	House prices have flatlined across the country, rising by less than 1% in 2019, according to the latest property report.
EN_021	3	Prices are expected to remain stable in the coming months as the spectre of Brexit and the Central Bank’s decision not to tweak mortgage lending rules are factored in.
EN_021	4	The report, published by MyHome.ie and Davy, found that annual inflation has now slowed to just 0.72% nationwide.
EN_021	5	In the last quarter of the year, prices declined by 0.45% nationally and by 0.5% in Dublin.
EN_021	6	The average price for new sales nationally is now €267,000, while in Dublin it is €374,000.
EN_021	7	The findings come just days after property website Daft.ie found reported that prices were down by 1.2% in 2019.
EN_021	8	It was the first fall in prices since 2012.
EN_021	9	Conal MacCoille, chief economist with Davy Research, said the slowdown was “inevitable”.
EN_021	10	Mr MacCoille said prices are flatlining as buyers and sellers wait “for clarity on Brexit”.
EN_021	11	“The Central Bank of Ireland rules have stopped first-time buyers taking out too much mortgage debt this time around,” he added.
EN_021	12	The analysis shows the average residential transaction in Ireland — some €292,000 — is now 6.8 times the average income of €43,000, slightly lower than the rate in the UK, where the average transaction is seven times average income.
EN_021	13	Quarter on quarter, prices declined by 0.45%.
EN_021	14	Annually, there has been a slight increase on a national basis — up 1.4% — but prices have flatlined in the capital as inflation dropped to zero.
EN_021	15	It means that 2019 was the first year in which house prices increased at a slower pace than earnings since 2012.
EN_021	16	The median asking prices: Cork €235,000, up 1.73% versus 2018; Kerry €155,000, up 3.33%; Limerick €210,000, up 7.69%; Waterford €175,000, up 4.17%; Tipperary €150,000, up 3.45%; Kildare €220,000, no change; Dublin €320,000, up 1.59% Regionally, patterns vary widely.
EN_021	17	In Leinster, the picture was broadly one of slowdown: Prices fell in Laois, Offaly and Louth, and remained flat in Carlow and Longford.
EN_021	18	Even in Wexford, where prices increased, it was marginally by just 2.6%.
EN_021	19	In Munster, prices in Clare bucked the trend, rising by 11.7%.
EN_021	20	However, there is clear evidence of a slowdown elsewhere.
EN_021	21	In Cork City, prices have declined by almost 2%.
EN_021	22	In Tipperary prices were up 2.4% to €175,000 but were flat in Waterford, also at €175,000.
EN_021	23	In Waterford City, prices were up 7.8% to €139,000.
EN_021	24	The report shows some turbulence in the market.
EN_021	25	There was an 11% decline in the number of homes listed for sale, for example, to just 19,300.
EN_021	26	Mortgage lending to first-time buyers is increasing, though, up 15% in the first three quarters of 2019.
EN_021	27	In Dublin, high-value transactions — those worth more than €500,000 — are down 8%, but those in the €300,000-400,000 bracket are up 7%.
EN_021	28	Housing completions also passed the 20,000 mark last year, while commencements are in the region of 26,000.
EN_021	29	While Central Bank estimates have identified a need for an escalation in the number of builds, Mr MacCoille said these figures are positive.
EN_021	30	The rental sector remains under pressure, with rents up 4.5% in the year to November.
EN_021	31	The buy-to-let sector is showing no signs of life, with just 884 buy-to-let mortgages approved in the first three quarters of 2019, a 19% decrease.
EN_021	32	Looking forward, MyHome.ie managing director Angela Keegan forecasts “more settled price expectations” due to the “clarity” provided by Brexit.
EN_021	33	“For most of the year, we understandably saw prospective purchasers being reluctant to take the plunge due to these two unresolved issues, leading to sluggish house price inflation,” she said.
EN_031	1	AIB deputy chair says pay restrictions ‘key concern’ for investors
EN_031	2	AIB deputy chairperson Catherine Woods said the bank’s efforts to attract and retain staff were partly depended on its “ability to compete with the reumuneration practices of other employers”.
EN_031	3	AIB’s deputy chairperson Catherine Woods told shareholders at the group’s annual general meeting on Wednesday that ongoing pay restrictions and a ban on bonuses across bailed-out banks “remains a real concern” for its large institutional shareholders.
EN_031	4	Ms Woods, who was standing in for group chairman Richard Pym , who is undergoing minor surgery, told the meeting in Dublin that AIB’s efforts to attract and retain staff were partly depended on its “ability to compete with the reumuneration practices of other employers”.
EN_031	5	She said that the bank, which saw Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe use the State’s 71 per cent shareholding to shoot down its plans to reintroduce a long-term incentive plan for top executives at last year’s agm, has held off on making a new proposal as outside consultants complete a review of remuneration in the sector for the State.
EN_031	6	“We continue to look forward to the conclusion of the minister’s remuneration review,” Ms Woods said.
EN_031	7	Remuneration review.
EN_031	8	A draft copy of the report, filed by consultants Korn Ferry late last year, is understood to highlight that the current restrictions are unsustainable, although Mr Donohoe has said he has no plans to ease them.
EN_031	9	and Donal Galvin take over as chief executive and chief financial officer, respectively, in recent months following the departure of previous incumbents, Mr Hunt said on Wednesday that the company has had a “good start” to 2019 and is “trading in line with expectations”, even though the business is operating “under the cloud” of Brexit.
EN_031	10	The company is seeking shareholder approval at the agm on a proposal to pay a larger-than-expected 42 per cent jump in its annual dividend to €461 million, after its net loans grew and non-performing loans level declined 41 per cent to €6.1 billion last year.
EN_031	11	This was aided by the sale of a soured portfolio to US private equity group Cerberus .
EN_031	12	In 2013 the bank had more than €30 billion of problem loans.
EN_031	13	Loan sale.
EN_031	14	AIB is considering the sale of a final batch of problem loans later this year as it seeks to reduce its non-performing loans (NPLs) by as much as €3 billion in order to cut its NPLs ratio to about 5 per cent from about 8 per cent, currently.
EN_031	15	The bank sold a €1 billion portfolio of mainly investment loans to a consortium led by US distressed debt group Cerberus earlier this month.
EN_031	16	However, the deal also included 220 owner-occupier mortgages and some agricultural assets that were used as security by borrowers for commercial property loans.
EN_031	17	A group of farmers and the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) gathered outside the meeting at a Dublin hotel to protest against the inclusion of agriculture assets in the recent loan sale.
EN_031	18	Speaking outside the meeting, the IFA’s farm business chairman Martin Stapleton said it was “wrong” that AIB would sell these loans to a fund that was “not interested in resolving issues by entering into long-term arrangements with farmers”.
EN_044	1	One in five parents seek mental health support for children during pandemic
EN_044	2	Anxiety, loneliness and isolation are among the issues identified as a concern by parents, with many also fearful of how children will re-adjust as society reopens
EN_044	3	Wed, 14 Jul, 2021
EN_044	4	A survey of almost 2,000 parents, carried out by Walk in My Shoes, a campaign by St Patrick’s Mental Health Services in conjunction with the National Parents Council Primary, found families were concerned about the impact of the pandemic and how their children will adjust to further changes as society re-opens.
EN_044	5	Paul Gilligan, chief executive of St Patrick’s, said now is the time to plan for any increase in the number of young people seeking help.
EN_044	6	According to the survey: 55% of parents are concerned about the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their children’s mental health; Almost 20% of children received some form of mental health support over the course of the pandemic; including private counselling and school counselling; 25% of parents are concerned about their child’s readjustment as society opens up again.
EN_044	7	The survey also found parents were aware of social media overuse by their children.
EN_044	8	It highlighted a lack of physical connection and aggression or lashing out as some of the ways children acted out.
EN_044	9	"Mr Gilligan said some of the children among the 20% who sought assistance since the start of the pandemic would have done so anyway, but added: ""There is no doubt that this pandemic has not helped."
EN_044	10	"No child will benefit from this."""
EN_044	11	"Pandemic 'a psychological trauma' He said this included a group of children who otherwise may not have required any mental health supports, but he added the pandemic has been ""a psychological trauma of mammoth proportions"" and planning for increased demand for services needs to happen now."
EN_044	12	"""I think we have to see this in context, the last thing we want to do is talk ourselves into a mental health emergency,"" he said, adding that any talk of a mental health ""tsunami"" was unhelpful."
EN_044	13	We don't know what is going to happen.
EN_044	14	"What we know is kids are experiencing levels of distress but we need to balance that with the fact that children have amazing resilience."""
EN_044	15	He said the move to greater availability of online resources had been positive but this needed to be expanded.
EN_044	16	"The majority of respondents had younger children of primary school age and Aine Lynch, chief executive of the National Parents Council, said: “While the results of this survey have illustrated an understandable level of concern about children’s mental health among parents, it has also shown that parents are actively seeking and engaging in ways to support their child’s mental health at this time and to address their concerns, whether that be online via mental health websites or through a GP, teacher or friends and family."""
EN_044	17	Self-harm.
EN_044	18	Meanwhile, new data from the National Self-Harm Registry has shown the rate of self-harm presentations to emergency departments (EDs) fell by 3% last year compared to the figure for 2019.
EN_044	19	It is the first time the registry, operated by the National Suicide Research Foundation (NSRF), has been able to compare annual figures for the number of presentations across 15 EDs.
EN_044	20	Dr Mary Joyce of the NSRF said there could be a number of factors for the number of presentations last year, including a reluctance to attend a hospital during a pandemic.

EN_046	1	Authorities: No need to make face masks mandatory at present
EN_046	2	Both the Health Board (Terviseamet) and the government agree on this point, with Prime Minister Jüri Ratas (Center) saying that mask-wearing is up to individual discretion, though he does so when, for instance, visiting medical institutions.
EN_046	3	"""As to whether there is any sense that [wearing a face mask] should be made mandatory, then I definitely don't get that feeling at the moment."
EN_046	4	"But … I think that wearing a mask in certain places is very justified,"" Ratas said."
EN_046	5	Some countries have made face mask-wearing in public obligatory, including the U.K., which from Saturday adds museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship to the list of venues where this must be done .
EN_046	6	Face masks in stores have been mandatory for all there for two weeks, with fines for non-compliance being £50-100 (€55.40-110.80).
EN_046	7	Finnish-owned retailer Prisma says that sales of protective masks at its stores have increased significantly in recent weeks, with both medical disposable masks and reusable masks of different materials being in demand.
EN_046	8	Prisma's sourcing director, Tõnis Tomingas, said that the likelihood that in any second wave of coronavirus, protective masks will be mandatory in most public spaces, must be taken into account.
EN_046	9	"""At the moment, protective masks are mandatory when traveling abroad by plane."
EN_046	10	Some nightclubs have begun to require their visitors to wear them.
EN_046	11	"Since the coronavirus spreads also through the air as a droplet infection, it is responsible to wear masks in crowded places and vehicles,"" he added."
EN_046	12	Hanna Sepp, chief specialist at the Health Board's department of infectious diseases surveillance and epidemic control says those whose work requires physical or close contact with other people, such as health care workers, should wear a mask in connection with the spread of the coronavirus, but in terms of the populace as a whole, only those who are sick and have to leave the house for unavoidable reasons should for sure don a face mask.
EN_046	13	Sepp reiterated that wearing a mask is recommended for all in enclosed, crowded places such as shopping malls, individual shops, and on public transit.
EN_046	14	Tõnis Tomingas of Prisma says the company's parent group has stocked up on face masks, meaning additional stocks can be brought to market in Estonia if need be.
EN_046	15	The prime minister also doubled down on the importance of the current regime, notably the two-week self-quarantine requirement for arrivals from states with more than 16 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants reported in the previous 14 days.
EN_049	1	Reid says hospitals under 'very serious pressure' due to Covid surge
EN_049	2	HSE CEO PAUL Reid has said hospitals across the country are now under ‘very serious pressure’ due to the high level of Covid-19 in the community.
EN_049	3	In an update to the Oireachtas Health Committee this morning, Reid said Ireland is now “firmly in the midst of a fourth surge in Covid-19 infections”.
EN_049	4	“The entire health system, both acute hospitals and community are now under very serious pressure,” he said.
EN_049	5	Reid said the HSE has had to take immediate measures in response to hospital and ICU pressures, including the short-term prioritisation of unscheduled care, and increasing surge capacity through providing additional beds, particularly in ICU.
EN_049	6	He said the system can surge to 350 ICU beds.
EN_049	7	“I know that the resurgence of the virus, and the response now required, will place even more pressure on staff,” he told the committee.
EN_049	8	Reid explained to the committee that the winter season in any year presents additional challenges to health systems, but theses pressures are now “compounded by the massive increase in Covid-19 infections we are currently experiencing”.
EN_049	9	He said this rise in cases is leading to presentations in emergency departments and onwards to wards and intensive care units.
EN_049	10	“Emergency Departments continue to operate distinct pathways of care for Covidand non-Covid patients, and this places a huge demand on staffing and space available,” he said.
EN_049	11	Reid told the committee that a consequence of the significant rise in hospital attendances through emergency departments has been the necessity to relieve the overall pressure on hospitals by evaluating planned procedures and cancelling less urgent appointments for both day cases and in-patients.
EN_049	12	He said the number of cancellations and non-booking of planned surgery has been growing due to the growing incidence of Covid-19 in hospitals.
EN_049	13	He said the HSE’s winter plan will focus on avoidance of hospital admittance unless absolutely necessary, patient flow through hospitals, and safe and timely departure of patients from hospital.
EN_049	14	The use of private hospitals where required to increase capacity in the short-term is part of the plan, he said.
EN_049	15	Reid also provided an update on the rollout of the Covid-19 booster vaccination programme.
EN_049	16	To date, more than 630,000 boosters have been administered.
EN_049	17	He said the over 80s and long-term care groups are “substantially complete” and more than half of over 70s (190,000 people) have received their jab.
EN_049	18	Among the over 60s, 43,000 boosters have been administered.

EN_078	1	Dubai royal family to fund TCD centre for Middle Eastern studies
EN_078	2	Trinity College has refused to reveal how much money is being donated by the Al Maktoum Foundation for the establishment of a new centre for Middle Eastern studies at the university.
EN_078	3	The foundation is owned by the ruling royal family of Dubai , which has been accused of human rights abuses.
EN_078	4	The university’s Al Maktoum Centre for Middle Eastern Studies, which will form part of Trinity’s faculty of arts, humanities and social sciences and was announced on Monday, was originally set to receive a donation of €5.5 million over a period of a decade.
EN_078	5	However, a Trinity spokesman has said this was no longer the case and that the foundation was not willing to disclose publicly how much money would be donated.
EN_078	6	He said the centre’s teaching and research would focus on history, culture, society and languages in the Middle East with a particular focus on the Arabic language but added that the Al-Maktoum family would not be involved in recruitment or have any control over the new centre.
EN_078	7	Asked whether the university had expressed misgivings around alleged human rights abuses, former Trinity board member and professor of economics Brian Lucey said the ruling classes of Dubai were “not the worst” when it came to seeking funding for educational purposes.
EN_078	8	“It would be lovely if we could get money from the Dalai Lama but the reality is the money has to come from somewhere.
EN_078	9	In the hierarchy of people from whom we would accept money, the ruling classes of Dubai are not the worst.”
EN_078	10	In March 2018 Princess Sheikha Latifa, the daughter of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, was forcibly returned to the United Arab Emirates after she tried to flee the country.
EN_078	11	More recently, Human Rights Watch criticised the UAE in its 2019 World Report for its “sustained assault” on freedom of expression, its leading role in the Saudi-led coalition operating in Yemen , its treatment of migrant workers in the country, discrimination against women and criminalisation of same-sex relationships.
EN_078	12	The group also criticised the UAE for continuing to block representatives from human rights organisations from visiting the country.
EN_078	13	Trinity College provost Dr Patrick Prendergast said the “generous gift” from the Al-Maktoum family had come at a time when Irish society must “seize the opportunity to enhance the role which all can play in a pluralistic society”.
EN_078	14	“Societal challenges created by multiculturalism also present unique opportunities for engagement and enrichment,” said Dr Prendergast.
EN_078	15	Minutes from a January 2016 Trinity College board meeting show the then proposed Al Maktoum Centre would be “the culmination of years of discussion and negotiation” with funding from the foundation spanning a 10-year period.
EN_078	16	‘Entirely secular’ Prof Juergen Barkhoff, head of the school of languages, said at the time that the centre would be “entirely secular in its approach with religion research in terms of its effects on the cultural, historical and political development of the regions only”.
EN_078	17	The meeting also notes that the Al Maktoum Foundation would take “a hands-off approach to the direction and management of the centre”.
EN_078	18	Chairman of the board of trustees of Al Maktoum College and the Al Maktoum Foundation his excellency Mirza Al Sayegh said the centre would continue the Dubai family’s long commitment of investment in both education and A statement from Trinity noted that the foundation’s work was “internationally recognised for its focus and contribution to the promotion of understanding and peace across cultures for its humanitarian work, notably in education”.
EN_078	19	The Al Maktoum Foundation funds the Islamic Cultural Centre in Clonskeagh , Dublin and is an Irish registered company with charitable status which is funded by large annual grants from the UAE’s ruling family.
EN_078	20	It also funds the Al Maktoum College of Higher Education in Dundee, Scotland which came under fire in 2012 after the former principal took a claim against the college for unfair dismissal and discrimination.

EN_086	2	More than 2,000 residents of West Sacramento, California, were without power overnight after an unexplained PG&E outage.
EN_086	3	The outage occurred late on Sunday night and affected 2,032 customers, according to CBS local .
EN_086	4	The outage is impacting areas between south of West Capitol Avenue and Interstate 80 towards Sacramento Avenue.
EN_086	5	The cause of the outage is unknown, but PG&E is currently investigating and estimates that the time of restoration will be 2.15 p.m.
EN_086	6	According to the PG&E outage map , two outages occurred within minutes of one another.
EN_086	7	One outage occurred at 10.59 p.m., though the cause is unknown.
EN_086	8	This power outage has affected 296 customers and is expected to be restored by 5 p.m.
EN_086	9	A second outage occurred at 11.09 p.m. and affected 12 customers.
EN_086	10	It is unclear if these outages are related to the outage that affected more than 2,000 PG&E customers.
EN_086	11	Newsweek has contacted PG&E for updates on the cause of the outage and number of customers affected.
EN_086	12	California has faced multiple planned power outages over the last month as wildfires affected the state.

EN_088	1	Banks in southern Europe, including Malta, at higher risk from climate change – ECB
EN_088	2	Last Updated on Thursday, 23 September, 2021 at 11:20 am by Associated Press
EN_088	3	The European Central Bank’s first climate stress test shows higher risks of loan defaults for banks in fire-plagued southern Europe, including Malta, and argues that an earlier and orderly shift to greener energy may have costs — but pay off for the economy over the long run.
EN_088	4	The bank warned that its two more negative scenarios — a hasty effort to catch up to the problem or simply doing nothing — risked much higher costs and losses in economic output, especially further in to the stress test’s 30-year time frame.
EN_088	5	The stress test published Wednesday compiled data gathered on more than 4 million companies worldwide and 1,600 banks in the 19-country eurozone where the ECB sets monetary policy.
EN_088	6	It probed the impact on economic output and bank finances under three scenarios: an orderly transition where measures to limit emissions are taking in time, a disorderly scenario where measures are taken late, and a final “hot house world” scenario where things stay as they are.
EN_088	7	The broad takeaway was that an orderly and swift transition “to minimize costs and maximize benefits outweighs short-term cost of transition to zero-carbon economy over the medium to long-term.”
EN_088	8	It called a more aggressive approach to energy transition “a golden opportunity” because the long-term advantages outweigh the initial costs.
EN_088	9	It warned that firms located in regions most exposed to changes in weather could face severe and frequent natural disasters, which would affect their creditworthiness.
EN_088	10	Such risks are unevenly distributed in Europe, with northern regions more prone to floods and southern countries more exposed to heat stress and wildfires.
EN_088	11	And the costs of the transition would hit industries such as coal mining and electricity generation that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases — and potentially their bank creditors whose finances would suffer if the loans or bonds aren’t paid back.
EN_088	12	In 2050, the likelihood of corporate loan defaults would be 8% higher in the hot house scenario than in an orderly transition for an average loan portfolio, but 30% more likely for the most vulnerable banks.
EN_088	13	The test had a strong focus on banks and the risk that climate change might increase credit defaults.
EN_088	14	The European economy depends on banks as the main source of finance for firms, in contrast to the U.S. where financial markets play a bigger role.
EN_088	15	The climate findings will be used for a further climate stress test of banks next year by the ECB’s bank supervisory arm.
EN_088	16	The study found that risks to bank balance sheets from the costs of transition to green energy were evenly distributed across the eurozone.
EN_088	17	The risks of default from climate change itself, in the form of bad weather and natural disasters, were more concentrated in the banks of southern European countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain and Malta.
EN_088	18	The Greek share of bank loans exposed to high physical risk, that is, the possibility that borrowers would be hit by fire or flood and not pay, was over 90%.
EN_088	19	High physical risk was defined as probability of over 1% that a borrower would suffer such an event in any given year.
EN_097	1	Rare Dose of Bipartisanship May Wipe Out Smoking at Atlantic City Casinos
EN_097	2	A bill that would prohibit smoking in Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos is seeing a rare dose of bipartisan support as more lawmakers in the state Legislature indicate they will vote for it.
EN_097	3	Republican state Senator Michael Testa announced Monday that he has added his support to the bill as a co-sponsor, according to a press release from the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights sent to Newsweek.
EN_097	4	A bill similar to this one died in last year's legislative session without a vote, according to the Associated Press.
EN_097	5	This new bill, S264, would amend the New Jersey Smoke-Free Air Act to prohibit smoking in casinos and simulcasting facilities, according to the bill's text.
EN_097	6	"""Casino workers should have the same right to work in a safe and healthy environment as any other worker in our state,"" Testa said in the press release."
EN_097	7	"""That's why I'm co-sponsoring S264 to eliminate the casino smoking loophole."
EN_097	8	"We can both protect the health of casino workers and their guests while safeguarding our state's thriving gaming industry."""
EN_097	9	Testa's addition as a co-sponsor brings the total number of sponsors for S264 to seven, according to legislation-tracking website LegiScan.
EN_097	10	The other sponsors include state Senators Shirley Turner, Joseph Vitale, Patrick Diegnan, Teresa Ruiz, Vincent Polistina and Vin Gopal.
EN_097	11	"All except for Polistina and Testa are ""We have support from Republicans and Democrats, as well as legislators across New Jersey, because they recognize that it's wrong to treat us differently than every other worker in our state,"" said Nicole Vitola, co-leader of Casino Employees Against Smoking's Effects (CEASE), in a press release."
EN_097	12	"""Senator Testa understands the urgency of our fight and we are grateful that he is joining us to get this bill across the finish line."""

EN_097	16	Casino workers are at higher risk for lung and heart disease due to secondhand smoke, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the bill says.
EN_097	17	The air in casinos can also have up to 50 times more cancer-causing particles than the air on rush-hour highways, according to a study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.
EN_097	18	Smoking is currently restricted to 25 percent of a casino floor, according to The Press of Atlantic City
EN_097	19	A Senate committee that the bill has been referred to is meeting Thursday, but it is not on the committee's agenda, the AP reported.
EN_097	20	"However, a spokesperson for Assembly speaker Craig Coughlin said, ""The speaker is prepared to thoroughly and thoughtfully review the bill"" should the bill be reintroduced there."
EN_097	21	Smoking in casinos was temporarily prohibited during the pandemic, The Press of Atlantic City reported.
EN_097	22	The ban was lifted last summer, and politicians have attempted to make the ban permanent ever since.
EN_098	1	Moon missions will help to pave the way for humans on Mars, astronaut says
EN_098	2	It will be the first time a woman walks on the Moon, and US Navy Lieutenant Commander Barron is among those hoping to make history.
EN_098	3	Last year, she returned from six months on the International Space Station, where she and her crew conducted hundreds of scientific experiments.
EN_098	4	We know that we will not succeed on our own, and so the more people, perspectives, backgrounds, we can bring in, the more successful the stronger our team will be.
EN_098	5	Helping the agency to prepare for future trips to the Moon, the astronaut told the PA news agency she, along with other astronauts who have spent time in space, have a unique perspective to offer.
EN_098	6	She said: “One of the things they were talking about doing for Artemis was increasing the amount of water volume we get to take with us to drink to hydrate, but they’re not talking to the waste management team who’s manifesting essentially the adult diapers we wear to deal with urine when we’re in this spacesuit.
EN_098	7	“You’re like ‘great that we have more water to drink, but where’s it gonna go?’.
EN_098	8	“So there’s things like that, that as a user of that technology, it’s the first thing you think of when you hear we’re gonna give you more water.”
EN_098	9	Lt Cmdr Barron, said she is part of a class of Nasa astronauts that could be selected to be the next humans to step on the Moon.
EN_098	10	She told PA: “I think we need diversity of all kinds to tackle these incredible challenges – sending human beings to live in space continuously for decades aboard the space station, sending human beings to the moon again, to the lunar South Pole, creating a permanent human presence on and around the Moon, and eventually sending human beings to Mars.
EN_098	11	“That is a tough challenge.
EN_098	12	“We know that we will not succeed on our own, and so the more people, perspectives, backgrounds, we can bring in, the more successful the stronger our team will be.”
EN_098	13	Asked what she was hoping for from the Artemis missions, she added: “We have a tonne to learn about the Moon that can tell us about our planet and our solar system.
EN_098	14	“We explored this tiny little area of the Moon during Apollo.
EN_098	15	“And so I’m really excited to see the scientific discoveries that will come out of the geology work we do there.
EN_098	16	“But for me, I’m also super excited that we’re going to be developing and testing all the technologies that we’ll use to send human beings to Mars.
EN_098	17	“Artemis is the proving ground, the Moon is the proving ground for all of those things.
EN_098	18	“And so we’re going to be developing, testing, refining those technologies along the way.”
EN_098	19	Lt Cmdr Barron was speaking ahead of giving a talk at the Cambridge Festival which runs from March 17 to April 2 and features hundreds of events on subjects ranging from politics and technology to health and climate change.
EN_098	20	She spent a year at the University of Cambridge earning her Master’s degree in Nuclear Engineering.
EN_098	21	Lt Cmdr told PA: “It’s always exciting for me to engage with the community and Cambridge because it was such a formative experience for me to be around such a diverse community.
EN_098	22	“Diverse in every way, but the intellectual diversity and passion was really interesting to me to see people studying such a wide range of things with such passion.
EN_098	23	“And really this belief that what they were working on would make the world better for others.
EN_098	24	“And for me, that was super inspiring, and that really broadened my horizons in terms of thinking about how I could contribute.”
EN_098	25	Named after the Greek goddess of the Moon and sister to the god Apollo, namesake of Nasa’s first Moon missions, the Artemis programme will see the construction of the Lunar Gateway – a new space station where astronauts will be able to live and work.
EN_098	26	Nasa expects the first Artemis astronauts to land on the Moon in 2025.
EN_102	1	'Too early' to say how schools will be able to re-open in September, says education minister
EN_102	2	EDUCATION MINISTER JOE McHugh has said that it is too early to say how schools will reopen fully in September due to the need for social distancing.
EN_102	3	Schools and colleges have been shut since March in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus.
EN_102	4	Joe McHugh told RTE’s The Week In Politics programme he has set up an advisory group to examine the issue and the group will work towards opening schools.
EN_102	5	He said: “NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) advice is that schools will reopen in September, so the question is now how can we do that in a safe way and I think it is too early to say how that will look.
EN_102	6	But that is the job we have started and we will continue to work our way through it.”
EN_102	7	Asked if schools reopening would mean smaller classes or start times being staggered, he said: “We are trying to give as much clarity as possible and the last thing I want to be doing in the month of May is to say exactly what this will look like.
EN_102	8	That is why I want to have a proper consultation about it.
EN_102	9	“I am going to work with the advisory group that I have set up and that work is going to continue.
EN_102	10	“We are going to work with all the stakeholders and I have already started the conversation a number of weeks ago.
EN_102	11	“With a lot of the stakeholders, whether it is post-primary or primary, we are going to work towards opening the schools.”
EN_102	12	It was announced on Friday that the Leaving Certificate examinations will not go ahead this summer as a result of the pandemic.
EN_102	13	Instead, students will have the option of receiving grades calculated by their teachers based on their school work.
EN_102	14	McHugh rejected accusations of unfairness about the new system and said students from all types of schools will be treated fairly.
EN_102	15	He said: “I want to categorically say that any student, just because they go to a certain school, that they will be marked any differently to anyone else is just not the case.
EN_102	16	“You could have a situation where once a principal sends off the results of any school, whether it is a community school, a Deis school, a private school, where the system will look at some students maybe marked too harshly, some students could be marked leniently, there will be different evaluations.”
EN_108	1	Welsh rugby players’ union: ‘Players have had enough’ amid contract uncertainty
EN_108	2	The situation has been magnified due to recruitment being on hold and next season’s playing budgets not yet being finalised for Wales’ four professional regions of Cardiff, Ospreys, Dragons and Scarlets.
EN_108	3	Strike action by players is a possibility as the Wales squad prepare for their next game (Bradley Collyer/PA) A new financial agreement between the regions and the Welsh Rugby Union has still to be confirmed in writing, sparking concern that a sizeable number of players whose contracts expire at the end of this season will head away from Wales, with a huge sense of uncertainty currently engulfing them and their families.
EN_108	4	“What is deeply concerning is that until the long-form agreement is signed and active, no players’ futures are guaranteed,” the WRPA said in a statement.
EN_108	5	“This is having a profound effect on players – especially those out of contract – and is placing unacceptable strain on mental health and overall wellbeing.
EN_108	6	“Strike action is something that we wish to see avoided as a players’ union and our members want to be taking the field as they always have.
EN_108	7	Players have had enough.
EN_108	8	This is not a game of 'Championship Manager' “But clearly, the anxiety caused by the situation is now affecting the lives and profession of players.
EN_108	9	“Players have had enough.
EN_108	10	This is not a game of ‘Championship Manager’.”
EN_108	11	Negotiations on the future of the professional game in Wales are handled by the Professional Rugby Board (PRB), which comprises representatives from each of the regions, acting WRU chief executive Nigel Walker, WRU finance director Tim Moss and two independent members, including chair Malcolm Wall.
EN_108	12	Walker met with senior members of the Wales squad on Wednesday “to further clarify the current position”.
EN_108	13	WRU comment https://t.co/ic1IqNcGHZ Welsh Rugby Union (@WelshRugbyUnion) February 15, 2023 The WRU then issued a statement, in which PRB chair Malcolm Wall said: “The new agreement offers a complete funding package to the professional game in Wales, but it does come with financial limitations which will directly affect salary negotiations.
EN_108	14	“The cold facts are that the WRU and clubs have been paying salaries that their businesses cannot afford, so the new agreement establishes a new framework for contract negotiations.
EN_108	15	“The average salary of a Welsh professional rugby player under the new framework will be around £100k-per-year.”
EN_108	16	The WRPA, though, criticised the publishing of the statement, which was released while the Wales squad trained at their Vale of Glamorgan base.
EN_108	17	The Wales squad are currently training at their Vale of Glamorgan base (David Davies/PA) “The WRPA is extremely disappointed at the publishing of a statement by PRB and the way it portrays the players within Wales and ongoing WRPA relations with the PRB,” the players’ organisation added.
EN_108	18	“Players feel let down, that once again they are the ones that are being leveraged.
EN_108	19	“A point raised in the PRB statement mentions that ‘clubs have been paying salaries that their businesses cannot afford’.
EN_108	20	“Players and agents have negotiated contracts within the parameters directed by the PRB and its previous incarnations.
EN_108	21	Once again, the players are expected to clean up someone else’s mess.
EN_108	22	Walker met with senior members of the Wales squad on Wednesday ‘to further clarify the current position’ (Mike Egerton/PA) “In the meeting with Nigel Walker, the players haven’t asked for anything unreasonable, nor an increase to the funding model.
EN_108	23	“We understand that negotiations are complex, but this particular issue has been ongoing for a prolonged period of time with deadlines set and missed, promises made and broken.
EN_108	24	“We urge all involved at PRB to prioritise fair agreement urgently and to acknowledge the position and wellbeing of the game’s main assets, which are its players.
EN_108	25	A satisfactory resolution must be found swiftly, so that all parties can move forward.”

EN_110	7	The Facts.
EN_110	8	September 1, 2021 Regeneron's monoclonal antibody treatment, REGEN-COV, is a mixture of two separate monoclonal antibodiescasirivimab and imdevimab.

EN_110	10	"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) authorized the treatment for ""emergency use as post-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) for COVID-19 in adults and pediatric individuals (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death."""
EN_110	11	In the development of the Regeneron treatment, the HEK293T cell line was used in an experiment during the testing process.
EN_110	12	These cells are a variant of HEK293 cells.

EN_122	4	The freeze on the recruitment of new posts will apply “until satisfactory financial plans [from the various hospital groups and CHOs] have been received, endorsed centrally and are demonstrating good evidence of traction”.
EN_122	5	Labour’s Alan Kelly, who released a copy of the letter this morning, said that an urgent explanation is now essential on why this is happening, and what roles are being blocked.
EN_122	6	“What this letter shows is that the 2019 budget is being used to cover overruns from last year.
EN_122	7	The letter specially says no new or replacement posts can proceed to offer stage.
EN_122	8	It is quite unbelievable that in critical service areas where specialist staff may retire or leave they now can’t be replaced, nor according to this letter can people on career break decide to come back over the next three months.
EN_122	9	Essentially they will have to wait until the budget situation improves.
EN_122	10	Kelly also said that this measure will “further impact on waiting lists and the crisis in our A&Es”.
EN_122	11	“It’s unprecedented that only three months into the year the HSE have to tell all sections to stop recruiting,” he said.
EN_122	12	“It’s not clear if this decision was approved by the Minister for Health or Minister for Finance or why it’s being done now but we need to know that our health service can hire the staff it needs in the areas under pressure.”
EN_122	13	Speaking to RTÉ’s This Week programme this afternoon, Kelly added that he had spoken to trade unions who weren’t aware of the recruitment freeze.
EN_122	14	Meanwhile, Minister of State Sean Canney, an independent TD in government, told RTÉ’s The Week in Politics said “now is the time” that is appropriate for the HSE to step in to control recruitment and spending.
EN_122	15	“Each hospital group has to produce their recruitment strategy.
EN_122	16	Some have, some haven’t,” he said.
EN_122	17	Canney said it was important to have a plan now rather than in October.
EN_122	18	He added: “We need more frontline staff and we don’t want more managers.
EN_122	19	We want to make sure that every ounce of the billions going into health are used and directed to the right place.”
EN_122	20	In Budget 2019, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe announced an additional investment of €1.2 billion for health.
EN_122	21	The minister said recent years had seen “the highest level of health investment in the history of the State”.
EN_122	22	A spokesperson for Health Minister Simon Harris told TheJournal.ie : “We have increased the number of nurses, doctors and therapists every year.
EN_122	23	That will continue this year.
EN_122	24	I have spoken to the HSE today, who have assured me recruitment restrictions will not be introduced unless hospital managers fail to outline their budget plans.
EN_122	25	Health managers need to submit recruitment plans and credible plans will be supported.
EN_122	26	Groups that do not submit such plans need to be scrutinised.
EN_122	27	We allocated a €16 billion budget to the health service and it is important that budgets are adhered to.
EN_122	28	The 2019 Service Plan allows for recruitment across the health service.
EN_123	1	Ireland among worst-performing European countries for climate action – UN report
EN_123	2	Ireland is among the worst-performing European countries for climate action, according to the UN.
EN_123	3	The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index, launched on Tuesday at the UN Climate Conference (COP25) in Madrid, shows that although Ireland has slightly improved its position since last year, it still ranks among some of the worst-performing countries in Europe.
EN_123	4	The ranking is an improvement on last year, moving up by seven places, after Ireland was ranked the worst EU performer.
EN_123	5	The report reads: “Ireland’s GHG (greenhouse gas) per capita emissions remain at a relatively high level, and significant challenges lie ahead in closing Ireland’s emissions gap, meeting the (current) 2030 target and aligning Ireland’s emissions trajectory with a net zero goal for 2050.
EN_123	6	“Therefore, the country still ranks among the bottom ten performers in this indicator.”
EN_123	7	The report also criticises “the significant lack of progress in decarbonising key parts of the economy, mainly in agriculture, road transport and the residential sector”.
EN_123	8	It said: “The Government must go much further in implementing policies across all sectors that drive sustained emissions reductions over the next decade.”
EN_123	9	On a positive note for the Government, the index report welcomed Ireland’s new proposals set out in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, including putting the 2050 target into law and introducing legally binding five-year carbon budgets.
EN_123	10	Campaigners have long criticised Environment Minister Richard Bruton’s policies on the climate emergency, which they say do not go far enough to tackle the issues.
EN_123	11	Catherine Devitt, head of policy at the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition, said: “Ireland’s polluting emissions remain on an upward trend, the Government has yet to join other member states in calling for the EU to urgently raise its ambition in line with the Paris Agreement, and the scale of 2% emissions cuts per year presented in the Government’s action plan is wholly inadequate.
EN_123	12	If the Government is serious about wanting to improve its reputation on climate change and to do its fair share of the global effort, there needs to be a frontloading of concrete action across all sectors to ensure the scale of reductions needed can be delivered.
EN_123	13	“The science and the mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that we need far-reaching transformation across all aspects of society.
EN_123	14	“If the Government is serious about wanting to improve its reputation on climate change and to do its fair share of the global effort, there needs to be a frontloading of concrete action across all sectors to ensure the scale of reductions needed can be delivered.”
EN_123	15	The publication of the CCPI report comes as Mr Bruton is expected to participate in the high level segment on December 10 and 11 at COP25, where heads of state and government will make national statements on increasing their targets.
EN_123	16	The Department of Environment has been contacted for comment.
EN_126	1	Taoiseach 'doesn't detect' that teachers want to 'go down the route' of industrial action
EN_126	2	TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said that he doesn’t think that many teachers want to go down the route of industrial action.
EN_126	3	His comments come after members of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) voted to take industrial action unless the government addresses several issues related to Covid-19 in schools.
EN_126	4	Among the issues teachers have raised include the redefining of close contacts in schools and the introducing a serial testing programme.
EN_126	5	Teachers voted in favour of taking industrial action, up to and including strike action, but Martin said today that he “doesn’t detect that many teachers want to go down that route”.
EN_126	6	“Many friends of mine are teachers, I keep in regular touch with them to get a sense of what it’s like, how they’re coping.
EN_126	7	They want to be in school, they really get the importance of it for the children’s development,” he said.
EN_126	8	The Taoiseach acknowledged that the current environment for teachers is “challenging” and that Covid-19 has meant “a different type of learning” for teachers.
EN_126	9	“It’s a different type of education, the classroom is a much different place for the children and for the teachers.
EN_126	10	And therefore it’s not easy, and I don’t underestimate the impact,” he said.
EN_126	11	The Taoiseach also said that after this week’s mid-term break “school teams” will be established to see if there are specific areas that could be improved upon.
EN_126	12	“There will be school teams established now after this break involving both public health and education and also more regular engagement between public health at national level, and unions at national level.
EN_126	13	Sort of weekly updates in terms of any issues that people may have.
EN_126	14	And we can always improve,” he said.
EN_126	15	There had been previous suggestions that schools may close for an additional week after this week’s midterm break , as is happening in Northern Ireland, but Martin made it clear that this is not happening.
EN_126	16	“We have no reason not to say that they will open on Monday, of course they will open on Monday,” he said.
EN_126	17	The Taoiseach added: “NPHET and the public health authorities are absolutely clear that schools are safe.
EN_126	18	The Chief Medical Officer said to me last week that they’re safer than being outside of school, certainly for teenagers and that age cohort.”
EN_126	19	Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said he wanted to “acknowledge the extraordinary work” that the teachers have done since the return of school “every single day”.
EN_126	20	Donnelly also cited figures previously released by health officials about positivity rates in schools as evidence of why they are safe.
EN_131	1	Demonstrations planned after 800 P&O Ferries workers sacked and replaced
EN_131	2	A SERIES OF demonstrations will be held in the UK today against P&O’s “appalling” decision to sack 800 seafarers.
EN_131	3	Unions and politicians condemned the move, blamed by the company on losses of £100 million following the slump in travel because of the pandemic.
EN_131	4	The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) is seeking legal advice to challenge the sackings.
EN_131	5	It said the UK has seen one of the most “vicious examples of despotic employer behaviour” and one of the most shameful episodes in its recent industrial history.
EN_131	6	Announcing the decision yesterday, the ferry operator, bought by Dubai-based logistics giant DP World in 2019, insisted the decision to cut jobs was “very difficult but necessary” as it was “not a viable business” in its current state.
EN_131	7	The 800 workers were sacked immediately, with no notice, so they can be replaced by cheaper labour.
EN_131	8	Security guards boarded ships with handcuffs to remove fired crew, it was alleged.
EN_131	9	The union called for mass trade union and wider public support for demonstrations in Dover, Liverpool and Hull today.
EN_131	10	In a message to RMT members, general secretary Mick Lynch said: “It was with deep shock that I learned the news of the wholesale job cuts taking place at P&O Ferries, but I am sure that my shock was nothing as compared to the devastation this news brought to you and your colleagues.
EN_131	11	“P&O’s decision to lay off 800 workers is a kick in the teeth to the hard-working members of staff who have kept the business running through the global health crisis.
EN_131	12	“The RMT has received reports that security guards at Dover have boarded ships with handcuffs to remove crew so they can be replaced with cheaper labour.
EN_131	13	This union is horrified that P&O Ferries can treat their loyal workforce in such a despicable manner.
EN_131	14	“P&O Ferries claimed almost £15 million in Government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees.
EN_131	15	P&O is owned by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai.
EN_131	16	It paid a £270 million dividend to shareholders in 2020.
EN_131	17	“This appalling situation has arisen as a result of DP World wishing to maximise their profits and the failure of the Government to intervene and protect the jobs of you and your colleagues.
EN_131	18	“Your union is seeking advice on what legal action can be taken.”
EN_131	19	Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee, said P&O had made “an appalling error”.
EN_131	20	“If they do not reverse immediately and reinstate the employees and follow proper process, it’s hard to see a way back for them commercially,” he said.
EN_131	21	“The parent DP World needs to understand that the British public will not do business with companies who treat their employees with such contempt.”
EN_131	22	UK Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said: “This is not a corporate restructure.
EN_131	23	It’s not the way we go about business in this country.
EN_131	24	“It is beneath contempt; the action of thugs.”
EN_131	25	P&O Ferries said in a statement: “We have made a £100 million loss year-on-year, which has been covered by our parent, DP World.
EN_131	26	This is not sustainable.
EN_131	27	“Our survival is dependent on making swift and significant changes now.
EN_131	28	Without these changes there is no future for P&O Ferries.”
EN_131	29	Sailings were halted yesterday morning and will remain suspended “for the next few days”, P&O Ferries told passengers.
EN_131	30	P&O Ferries operates four routes: Dover to Calais; Hull to Rotterdam; Liverpool to Dublin; and Cairnryan, Scotland, to Larne, Northern Ireland.
EN_151	1	Montana State Judge Blocks New Abortion Laws After State Supreme Court Declines to Intervene
EN_151	2	A Montana District Court Thursday further blocked three restrictive abortion laws from taking effect after the state's Supreme Court declined to rule on a related lawsuit.
EN_151	3	The laws would impose a series of limitations on abortions in the state, including banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and requiring at least two in-person health facility visits.
EN_151	4	They would also require doctors to offer women considering abortion a chance to listen to their fetus' heartbeat, as well as enacting further restrictions on access to abortion medication.
EN_151	5	District Judge Michael Moses had originally issued a preliminary ruling stopping the trio of laws, which were due to take effect on October 1.
EN_151	6	A lawsuit was first filed by Planned Parenthood on August 16 in an effort to halt the laws, which had first been passed by the Montana State Legislature.
EN_151	7	While the lawsuit made its way to the Montana Supreme Court, it was not ruled on and ended up being sent back to the lower courts.
EN_151	8	Moses ruled Thursday to block the laws, stating that their constitutionality was still being debated.
EN_151	9	"His order said that the laws would cause ""irreparable harm"" to women in Montana seeking an abortion, which he said was a ""constitutionally protected right"" that would also violate a woman's right to privacy."
EN_151	10	A previous state court ruling had said that denying a woman access to an abortion before the 24-week mark (when the fetus becomes viable) was unconstitutional.
EN_151	11	Moses said that the passage of these laws would infringe on this ruling.

EN_151	13	"""This is an important and hard-fought victory."
EN_151	14	"We're thrilled that the Montana District Court preliminarily blocked these unconstitutional laws, protecting Montanans' access to safe, legal abortion,"" the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Montana, Martha Stahl, said in a statement obtained by Newsweek ."
EN_151	15	"""All Montanans, particularly those living in rural areas, and Black, Indigenous, and Latino communities who are most impacted by these restrictions, deserve the freedom to make their own decisions about their bodies and their futures without political interference."""
EN_151	16	The president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Alexis McGill Johnson, also provided a statement.
EN_151	17	"""Today, abortion continues to be available for the state's 220,000 women of reproductive age a temporary reprieve from these unnecessary and cruel restrictions,"" she said."
EN_151	18	"""The laws blocked in Montana are among more than 100 anti-abortion laws enacted this year the most in any year since Roe v."

EN_160	1	Here's how to reduce food waste this Christmas week
EN_160	2	YOU MIGHT BE lucky enough to be planning a big Christmas meal for tomorrow.
EN_160	3	But will you have lots of leftovers – and will you end up binning them or working them into their own feast?
EN_160	4	The Environmental Protection Agency is drawing people’s attention to food waste this Christmas and new year.
EN_160	5	It says that in a recent EPA Stop Food Waste survey, half of the people surveyed noticed more food waste over the Christmas period than at other times of the year.
EN_160	6	“This is one of the most important climate actions we can take, and it saves money,” says the EPA of cutting down on food waste.
EN_160	7	It found that 70% of people surveyed admitted that they buy extra food ‘just in case’ they have unexpected visitors.
EN_160	8	Instead of overbuying, store food properly so it lasts longer, and use your leftovers, advises the EPA.
EN_160	9	It also points out the supermarkets won’t be closed for long during the festive season, so there might not be that much of a need to stock up.
EN_160	10	People surveyed said the most wasted food in their homes are brussels sprouts (32%), meat (30%) and potatoes (25%).
EN_160	11	Which is why the EPA suggests: “Why not make new traditions by not preparing foods that nobody really likes.”
EN_160	12	There are those who love a bit of leftovers though, as certain foods taste better the next day.
EN_160	13	A total of 72% of people surveyed said cold meats are their number one leftover.
EN_160	14	Most people surveyed prefer making sandwiches (65%) with their leftover turkey and ham after Christmas, while 25% of those surveyed make leftover turkey curry.
EN_160	15	People surveyed also said that stuffing (13%) and mince pies (21%) were least likely to go to waste, while only 7% of those surveyed eat vegetable leftovers.
EN_160	16	Cutting down on waste.
EN_160	17	The EPA suggests that people wanting to save leftovers should try ‘family style’ serving of food.
EN_160	18	Rather than plating individual meals, allow everyone to serve themselves from large serving dishes.
EN_160	19	This is because people are more inclined to save leftovers from a serving dish than off someone’s plate.
EN_160	20	Food safety kicks in here – once cooled, store leftovers in the fridge.
EN_160	21	Generally, you want to get the food into the fridge within a two-hour window, but as soon after it has cooled the better.
EN_160	22	Mary Frances Rochford, EPA Programme Manager said: “Christmas is of course a time for celebrating, but also a time when a lot of food is wasted.
EN_160	23	By taking some simple steps to manage our food, we cut the carbon footprint of the festive season; and also trim our shopping bills.
EN_160	24	This year we are encouraging every household to take steps to reduce their festive food waste and to always use the leftovers – especially on St Stephen’s Day which we call ‘National Leftovers Day’.”
EN_160	25	The EPA is asking people to make a New Year’s resolution to focus on food waste by: Buying only the food you need; Storing food properly and; Always using the leftovers.
EN_160	26	The EPA has ‘12 Days of Christmas Recipes’ and ‘Luscious Leftovers’ booklets on
EN_162	1	'No Nazis at UF' Demands School Cancel Donald Trump Jr.
EN_162	2	Event No Nazis at UF, a self-described radical organizing group, is demanding that the University of Florida cancel Thursday's speech by Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, and is calling for the school's president to resign.
EN_162	3	"""No Nazis at UF sees [University President Kent] Fuchs' inaction as deplorably condemnable when students continue to emphatically voice safety concerns about these right-wing agitators on campus,"" said Ashley Nguyen, a senior at the school and member of No Nazis at UF."
EN_162	4	The group also listed several other demands related to Trump's appearance, including that his $50,000-speaker's fee is donated to underfunded cultural organizations on campus, that Student Body President Michael Murphy step down from his position, and that ACCENT, the student government speakers bureau that coordinated the event, be defunded.
EN_162	5	Despite the criticism ACCENT and the university said it would welcome Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle, a senior advisor on President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, as they have with all other speakers in the past.
EN_162	6	"Henry Fair, chairman of the ACCENT speakers bureau, told Newsweek that both Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle provide ""varying viewpoints"" and give students an opportunity to engage in ""thought-provoking dialogue and discourse."""
EN_162	7	Fuchs and Murphy did not respond for comment in time for publication.
EN_162	8	Nguyen criticized Fuchs for not barring some speakers, including white nationalist leader Richard Spencer.
EN_162	9	In 2017, the National Policy Institute, a white supremacist think tank, rented space on the University of Florida campus for Spencer's speech.
EN_162	10	Students at the time urged the administration to refuse to allow Spencer to use the space, but officials at the state university claimed their hands were tied because of free speech laws.
EN_162	11	Nguyen provided several reasons for defunding ACCENT.
EN_162	12	"First, she said, bringing Trump Jr. to campus showed that the school condoned the ""proliferation of right-wing speech that [incentivizes] and empowers hatred."""
EN_162	13	She also criticized ACCENT for not serving the student body well and for using student funds for what essentially would be a campaign stop.
EN_162	14	"""Despite what UF administration says about this not being a campaign stop for Trump's 2020 campaign, the ideas that Donald Trump Jr. will talk about will benefit Trump by bringing in more voters in 2020,"" Nguyen said."
EN_162	15	"""Bottom Line: Student funds should not be used for compelled political speech."""
EN_162	16	"Nguyen claimed it was time to disband and defund ACCENT because there wasn't a ""democratic foundation"" in place."
EN_162	17	By dismantling ACCENT, Nguyen said a new organization that permitted democratic student input could be built with the same goal in mind.
EN_162	18	No Nazis at UF wasn't the only group to raise concerns about how ACCENT chooses its speakers.
EN_162	19	Matt Barocas, president of the UF College Democrats, told Newsweek that after ACCENT announced Trump Jr. was coming to campus, students began discussing how they could be more involved in selecting speakers.
EN_162	20	Fair told Newsweek that ACCENT coordinated with members of the student government and used the same process it has used in the past.
EN_162	21	He declined to elaborate on what that process entailed.
EN_162	22	"""Part of our mission is to engage the UF campus community in discussions on important issues by bringing prominent, influential, and, oftentimes, controversial speakers to campus,"" Fair countered."
EN_162	23	"""This mission is something that we have followed for the entirety of ACCENT's 52-year history on campus, and continue to follow today."""
EN_162	24	The event is open to students only.
EN_162	25	ACCENT said the event was sold out.
EN_162	26	No Nazis for UF is planning to protest Thursday outside the auditorium where Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle are scheduled to appear.
EN_167	1	Video of Client Refusing Service From Female Staff at Car Dealership Sparks Outrage
EN_167	2	A video showing the sexist interaction between car dealership staff and a customer has gone viral, after the woman out-right refused to speak to female workers over their gender.
EN_167	3	"""When a Karen calls and we are all female service writers,"" Rachel captioned the TikTok video, which has since gained over 1.7 million views."
EN_167	4	"After greeting the customer and introducing herself, the woman swiftly requested to speak to a male member of staff instead, ordering: ""Autumn, I didn't ask for a female, I'd like to talk to a male."
EN_167	5	"My opinion is females don't belong in the service department, they go behind the scenes, doing the paperwork."""
EN_167	6	The department, according to the video, is run by a female service director who works over two dealerships and has over 25 years of experience.
EN_167	7	"""There's not a male in our service department,"" Autumn informed the customer."
EN_167	8	In response, the woman demanded to speak to a male member of staff named Mike Ashford instead, despite him working in sales, inducing a prompt call back later.
EN_167	9	"""I need to make an appointment for Saturday morning, eight o'clock,"" she said."
EN_167	10	"""I just hope there are no females on the desk when I get there."""
EN_167	11	"""There will be,"" promised an out-of-frame worker."
EN_167	12	"""There's no males in our service department mam,"" confirmed Autumn."
EN_167	13	"""Oh my god, that is totally messed up,"" responded the customer, adding that she needed an oil change."
EN_167	14	"""There better be a male mechanic that I can talk to."""
EN_167	15	"The customer continued to share an anecdote of her latest visit to the dealership, in which she claimed to have waited an hour for a five minute job and had to ""track down a male"" to get her car."
EN_167	16	In the video, however, on-screen text explained that the wait was simply due to having just one mechanic working due to COVID-19 restrictions, meaning appointments were running behind.
EN_167	17	"""As long as there is a male in the shop to change my oil, that will be fine,"" said the customer."
EN_167	18	"""I do not want a female working on my car."""
EN_167	19	The video can
EN_167	20	"According to Rachel who posted the video, the owner ""fired her as a customer"" upon seeing the clip."
EN_167	21	"""In his dealerships he has three female managers and eight service workers."
EN_167	22	"Females in our dealerships are treated with equal opportunities."""
EN_167	23	After gaining over 180,000 likes, many were left in shock at the blatant sexism displayed by the customer, especially considering she is a woman herself.
EN_167	24	"""I would have said sorry mam but this isn't 1950 anymore,"" commented one user."
EN_167	25	"""You should have told her that her husband needs to call to schedule the appointment to make sure it's the right service being requested,"" joked another."
EN_167	26	"""I was a female mechanic for years before I had my daughter."
EN_167	27	I was never disrespected more in my life by men and women.
EN_167	28	And I was one of the only certified techs in the shop.
EN_167	29	It was just customers of all ages.
EN_167	30	I would have people stand at the end of my bay watching me the whole time.
EN_167	31	It made me so uncomfortable.
EN_167	32	I never ever had an issue with any male co-workers thankfully.
EN_167	33	I had nothing but respect for them.
EN_167	34	"I even taught a few of them things,"" recounted another TikTok user."
EN_167	35	The issue of sexism in the auto-motor repair industry is an ever present one, and this video isn't the only time TikTok has served to bring it to light.
EN_167	36	Last month, a Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) qualified automotive technician went viral online after sharing criticism received from a colleague.
EN_167	37	"""You don't belong here,"" he told her in the clip."
EN_167	38	"""You don't belong here...in the mechanic world."""
EN_167	39	Despite women making up over half of drivers in the United States, they make up just one percent of automotive body and related repairers and 1.4 percent of automotive service technicians and mechanics, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
EN_167	40	"According to a 2017 survey of almost 900 women in the automotive repair industry, 68 percent have been told they're ""too aggressive,"" 62 percent have been accused of being ""too bossy,"" and 61 percent have been told they were ""too emotional."""

EN_174	2	A spokesman for the Cork County Fire Service said crews worked hard in very challenging conditions for many hours tackling the fires, some of which came very close to private houses
EN_174	3	The Mount Gabriel fire was the largest of 20 gorse or vegetation fires, primarily in the Mizen and Beara Peninsulas, to which all six West Cork fire brigades – Bantry, Castletownbere, Schull, Skibbereen, Dunmanway and Clonakilty - were called over the weekend.

EN_174	5	This fire was the largest of 20 gorse or vegetation fires, primarily in the Mizen and Beara Peninsulas, to which all six West Cork fire brigades – Bantry, Castletownbere, Schull, Skibbereen, Dunmanway and Clonakilty - were called over the weekend.
EN_174	6	Schull Fire Brigade, assisted by Dunmanway Fire Brigade, was called to the Irish Aviation Authority’s Mount Gabriel radar installation – the landmark ‘golf balls’ - at 8.48pm on Sunday by gardaí in Schull when the flames came very close to the radar compound, which provides vital radar data for flights operating in Irish airspace.
EN_174	7	The blaze came close enough to activate the buildings' fire alarms, but firefighters managed to prevent the blaze from reaching or damaging the compound.
EN_174	8	The fire was reported to be under control this afternoon, with wisps of smoke still visible in some areas, and hundreds of acres left scorched.
EN_174	9	A spokesman for the Cork County Fire Service said crews worked hard in very challenging conditions for many hours tackling this, and other fires, some of which came very close to private houses.
EN_174	10	“But crews were able to protect these houses.
EN_174	11	Fire crews had to contend with very heavy vegetation cover together with strong winds, which made it very difficult to fight the fires,” he said.
EN_174	12	The deployment of so many firefighters to so many blazes left some parts of the region without adequate emergency cover, Schull-based Fine Gael councillor Caroline Cronin said.
EN_174	13	Schull-based Fine Gael councillor Caroline Cronin said: “This is as big a fire that I have seen on Mount Gabriel and huge credit must go to the local team of Cork County Council fire crews.”
EN_174	14	Picture: Cllr Caroline Cronin.
EN_174	15	She paid tribute to the firefighters involved and said there is relief locally that nobody was injured, but she said the incidents highlight the lack of firefighters in general on the Mizen Peninsula.
EN_174	16	“This is as big a fire that I have seen on Mount Gabriel and huge credit must go to the local team of Cork County Council fire crews,” she said.
EN_174	17	"“Their dedication certainly prevented this getting completely out of control and threatening human life."""
EN_174	18	However, she said the two fire engines based in Schull which serve a huge geographical region are operating on a skeleton crew of just seven.
EN_174	19	“The part-time fire service has seen resignations and retirements and it is proving very difficult to attract new crews as the pay is unattractive to new entrants even though the commitment is so huge,” she said.

EN_179	1	New Jersey Man Seen in Viral Video Making Racist Tirade Against Neighbor Faces 22 Charges
EN_179	2	A New Jersey man who was filmed going on a racist tirade over the Fourth of July weekend is facing 22 charges against him, including bias, intimidation, and harassment, stemming from six separate incidents between 2016 and 2021.
EN_179	3	Edward Mathews, 45, of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, was filmed on July 2 getting into an argument with an African American neighbor.
EN_179	4	Mathews was arrested on July 5 after protestors gathered outside of his home in the days after the encounter.
EN_179	5	"Mathews can be heard in the amateur video yelling at the man, and confronting him as he says to ""back up, back up,"" while the man repeatedly says not to touch him."
EN_179	6	"Mathews then tells the man that ""it's not Africa,"" and ""[if you were born in America] then you know what common ground is."""
EN_179	7	The Burlington County Prosecutor's Office said that police were aware of Mathews from the prior complaints lodged against him, and specifically from racially charged incidents that happened last year, including when he reportedly damaged a car and left a threatening note.Mathews had reportedly forced the neighbor's friend to leave the area after a racist incident, according to police.
EN_179	8	During the protests at Mathews' house, a number of demonstrators were arrested after allegedly causing damage to the property and exhibiting violent behavior, like throwing rocks, spitting and using pepper spray.
EN_179	9	Edward Mathews, 45, is facing 22 charges after his racist rant against a neighbor in Mount Laurel, New Jersey was caught on cell phone video.
EN_179	10	Mathews reportedly has had 43 complaints registered against him going back to 2016.
EN_179	11	Many of the protestors were reportedly upset at the Mount Laurel Police Department's (MLPD) handling of the incidents, and in particular, felt the department has often shown Mathews favoritism.
EN_179	12	An independent investigation into these accusations did not implicate the department.
EN_179	13	"""With a broader perspective on the situation in the community, MLPD might have been able to devise an effective solution and brought relief to the residents Mathews had victimized sooner than his July 2 arrest,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement."
EN_179	14	"In regards to the independent investigation, the office said that they ""empathize with the residents of Essex Place who were on the receiving end of Mathews' conduct."""
EN_179	15	"""No one should have to endure racial harassment anywhere, but especially not in their own neighborhood and even in their own home,"" said one of the prosecutors."
EN_179	16	The investigation reportedly came to the conclusion that the MLPD viewed Mathews' conduct on a singular basis, and did not view him as a larger problem in the community, despite the number of complaints against him.
EN_179	17	Mathews has since apologized and admitted that he was drunk at the time the racist rant occurred.
EN_179	18	"""I cannot apologize enough."
EN_179	19	"I was drunk, I was out of line, I let my anger get the best of me,"" he told the Philadelphia-based news station WPVI-TV."

EN_180	1	Infant mortality rates at Northern Ireland baby homes ‘huge unanswered question’
EN_180	2	An expert panel has been commissioned to work with survivors of mother and baby homes and Magdalene laundries to design the shape of a future investigation.
EN_180	3	A public inquiry is among the options available.
EN_180	4	The panel was formed after Stormont-commissioned academic research on the institutions laid bare the suffering and degrading treatment experienced by thousands of young girls and unmarried women, and their children, who passed through the facilities.
EN_180	5	Many children born in mother and baby homes were ultimately moved to homes solely for babies.
EN_180	6	Judith Gillespie flanked by deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster at the publication of the research report on mother and baby homes and Magdalene laundries in January (Liam McBurney/PA) Giving evidence to the committee on Thursday, Mrs Gillespie said time constraints on the academic research meant it had been unable to fully explore concerns around missing records on what happened to many of the babies.
EN_180	7	She said sampling of records from one baby home in Belfast suggested very high infant mortality rates.
EN_180	8	“It (the research) just scratched the surface of this issue, what it discovered raised really big questions regarding what happened to the babies who ended up in baby homes or indeed were fostered or boarded out, as the term was back in the day,” said Mrs Gillespie.
EN_180	9	“And that’s a huge unanswered question.
EN_180	10	“Because of the time limitations on the research, they just weren’t able to get into this in any detail, but the sampling that they did do with regard to the one baby home on the Ormeau Road was really quite alarming with regard to the mortality rates of infants who ended up in the baby homes.
EN_180	11	“And we know that a very significant percentage of babies who were born to girls and women in mother and baby homes ended up in separate baby homes, and indeed were fostered or boarded, and there just isn’t that trail of outcomes from birth to what happened to them.
EN_180	12	It wasn’t possible for the researchers in the time that they had to answer those questions.
EN_180	13	“So any inquiry and the investigation that comes out of this, I think that will be a very significant plank of that investigation.
EN_180	14	Again that’s up to the panel to decide what that looks like, but, for me, that’s a really important part of the investigation because the babies who died don’t have a voice.”
EN_180	15	Caral Ni Chuilin (Niall Carson/PA) Sinn Féin committee member Caral Ni Chuilin had raised concern about missing death certificates.
EN_180	16	“I think that has been absolutely traumatic for the generations of families who’ve maybe just discovered that this happened, didn’t know and are going through their own truth recovery process and trying to locate those public records and they are simply not there,” she said.
EN_180	17	“We now know of one family of an elderly relative, a really elderly relative, a couple of years ago who was dying and made this massive disclosure, and the family have been trying to locate records and they’re not there, the birth certificate, and indeed they don’t know if the child survived or not.”

EN_182	14	Vice President Kamala Harris downplayed the idea of abortions on federal land in a CNN interview Monday, saying the administration was not considering the proposal.
EN_182	15	The idea of providing abortion services on federal land is backed by Senator of Massachusetts, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and other progressive Democrats in The proposal has gained traction in recent weeks after it was included in a letter Warren and other Senate Democrats sent to the White House outlining steps Democrats also called on the administration to expand access to medication abortion, and provide funding for people seeking abortion services outside of their home states, among other measures.
EN_182	16	But there is a limit on what Biden can do through executive action.
EN_182	17	Moves such as creating abortion clinics on federal lands would likely spark legal challenges from conservative governors and state lawmakers in states like Texas that have strict bans on abortion.

EN_186	2	One of the leading figures of the far-right Proud Boys group has admitted being part of the group that tore off a Black Lives Matter sign from a church and set fire to it following a MAGA rally in Washington.
EN_186	3	Proud Boys chairmen Enrique Tarrio claimed he is responsible for setting the banner on fire while posting a picture of himself with two other men using lighters to ignite the sign on social media site Parler.
EN_186	4	The BLM sign was removed from Asbury United Methodist Church, one of the oldest Black churches in Washington, during a night of violence in the capitol following a pro-Donald Trump protest on December 12, supporting his unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud during the election.

EN_186	15	I did it out of love.
EN_186	16	"Love for a country that has given my family SO MUCH,"" Tarrio added."

EN_187	1	Man accused of defacing mural of Michael Collins in West Cork remanded
EN_187	2	A man alleged to have defaced a Michael Collins mural in Clonakilty in West Cork has been refused bail after a court heard his behaviour may be “spiralling out of control”.
EN_187	3	Marlon Corrigan, with an address at Nordav Guesthouse in Tawnies, Clonakilty, appeared in custody before Skibbereen District Court on 11 criminal damage charges, all alleged to have occurred in Clonakilty in recent weeks.
EN_187	4	One of those charges relates to an extensive mural at Kent St in the town, which was completed this year and which marks a number of historical events, including a depiction of Michael Collins.
EN_187	5	The mural was defaced with silver spray paint.
EN_187	6	The charges before the court include alleged criminal damage offences between August 31 and September 1, and between September 8 and September 13, and include damage to the front of a wine bar and to an undertakers.
EN_187	7	Det. Garda Anthony Lyons objected to Mr Corrigan’s release on bail, evoking Section 2 of the Bail Act.
EN_187	8	He told Judge James McNulty he was objecting to bail on the basis of the strength of the evidence, the seriousness of the offences, and the fact that the alleged offences were committed while Mr Corrigan (26) was on bail in relation to other alleged offences.
EN_187	9	Det. Garda Lyons said gardaí had first responded to an eyewitness report of the mural being defaced with the tag CO2K.
EN_187	10	He said that when Mr Corrigan was arrested spray paint caps were found on his person and his runners had spray paint on them.
EN_187	11	Det. Garda Lyons described a “vast amount” of criminal damage around Clonakilty that is under investigation, as well as a number of witness statements and harvested CCTV.
EN_187	12	He told the judge a search warrant was obtained and in Mr Corrigan’s room a sketch pad with the CO2K tag was found, along with spray paints.
EN_187	13	“He was caught red-handed,” Det.
EN_187	14	Garda Lyons said.
EN_187	15	He also told the court a man matching Mr Corrigan’s description was “clearly captured on CCTV footage causing criminal damage at a number of locations”.
EN_187	16	The court was told Mr Corrigan is not taking his prescribed medication and Det.
EN_187	17	Garda Lyons said: “His behaviour appears to be spiralling out of control.”
EN_187	18	He said Mr Corrigan is currently on bail on a number of charges, including assault and threats to kill.
EN_187	19	Solicitor for Mr Corrigan, Margaret Collins, said her client was entangled in the legal system when really he needed to be in the medical system.
EN_187	20	She said Mr Corrigan had a diagnosis of autism and his ability to understand the charges and to consult with legal representatives was impaired.
EN_187	21	Judge McNulty said Ms Collins was making valid points but said the court had already “extended its kindness and compassion” to Mr Corrigan, including an earlier release into the care of a solicitor so he could visit his GP.
EN_187	22	The judge remanded Mr Corrigan in custody to appear before Clonakilty District Court on September 21.
EN_187	23	He also asked that Mr Corrigan’s medication be provided to him and that he resume taking it while in prison, subject to the approval of the prison doctor.

EN_195	1	Data Protection Commission seeks answers on destruction of mother and baby homes recordings
EN_195	2	DPC has raised concerns with the commission and has asked it to provide the justification and legal basis for the deletion of the records
EN_195	3	Tue, 02 Feb, 2021
EN_195	4	The Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) has written to the Mother and Baby Homes Commission over the destruction of recordings of witness testimony.
EN_195	5	It is understood the DPC has raised concerns with the commission and has asked it to provide the justification and legal basis for the deletion of the records.
EN_195	6	A total of 550 people provided personal accounts to the confidential committee as part of a five-year investigation into mother and baby homes, however, these recordings have been destroyed and no verbatim transcripts were made of the testimony.
EN_195	7	Survivors have strongly criticised the final report of the commission, which they say does not reflect their experiences.
EN_195	8	"They say the wiping of these recordings has created a ""verbatim void"" and means they have again been forced to argue the truth of their own life experiences."
EN_195	9	"The commission said those who came forward were ""orally asked for permission to record and told the recordings would be destroyed""."
EN_195	10	However, many survivors say they were not informed that the audio of their statements would be deleted.
EN_195	11	"""Survivors who gave evidence to the commission in good faith have stated that the record of their testimony was presented incorrectly, the recordings would have served as a means of verifying and allowing them to correct their written record to reflect the testimony they gave,"" said Maree Ryan-O'Brien of adoption rights group Aitheantas."
EN_195	12	"""Destroying the recorded statements effectively creates a 'verbatim void' – again leaving survivors having to argue the truth of their own life experiences,"" she said."
EN_195	13	It is understood that the DPC yesterday wrote to the Mother and Baby Home Commission, which will be wound up at the end of this month, to raise questions about the manner in which consent was obtained for the deletion of records.
EN_195	14	Such destruction is regarded as a form of data processing.
EN_195	15	"Guidelines published by the DPC say consent must also be ""freely given"" and should not be relied upon as a legal basis where there is a ""clear imbalance between the individual and the controller""."
EN_195	16	The DPC adds that this could occur in particular where the controller is a public authority, or employer, or otherwise in a position of power, and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in the context of that relationship.

EN_197	2	A neighborhood in Central Florida has been dealing with an unwelcome guest: a black bear has been spotted around the area for months and helped itself to produce growing on some residents' properties.
EN_197	3	The bear's presence in the Davenport, Florida , neighborhood of Thousand Oaks was first reported by WFLA on Sunday after resident Lynn Wracan sent to the outlet a video she had taken of the large animal making its way around.
EN_197	4	The video, posted on the outlet's official website along with the story, shows the bear fussing with a tree not far from where Wracan was filming.
EN_197	5	According to the resident, the animal initially seemed intrigued by some nearby Christmas lights, before moving on to the tree and attempting to grab the avocados growing on it.
EN_197	6	After that, it seems to curl up on the ground as if trying to go to sleep.
EN_197	7	"""No freaking way,"" Wracan can be heard saying in the video."
EN_197	8	"""No, he's eating our avocados."
EN_197	9	No, that's not a good idea, pumpkin.
EN_197	10	Oh, you're gonna take a nap now?
EN_197	11	"Seriously?"""
EN_197	12	Wracan further explained to WFLA that the animal has been stalking around the neighborhood for monthsat least since she moved to the Thousand Oaks area.
EN_197	13	In that time, it has made a consistent habit of pilfering produce growing on trees maintained by residents.
EN_197	14	Attempts to reach out to officials and have the animal safely removed from the neighborhood have not been fruitful, with local wildlife authorities stating that there is nothing they can do about the situation.
EN_197	15	It is suspected that, given the time of year, the black bear is most likely working to store calories for hibernation.
EN_197	16	Despite assurances from officials that the animal would go away soon, Wracan said that it is still being spotted in the neighborhood.
EN_197	17	"""Wildlife said we wouldn't see him in December, and he is here to gather as many calories as he can,"" she explained."
EN_197	18	The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission has advised that black bears are typically shy animals that are rarely known to attack humans , though they can be extremely dangerous if actively provoked.
EN_197	19	The best tactic, according to the commission, is to stay well away from them and not do anything to alert them of your presence.
EN_197	20	In emergency situations where a bear is attacking someone, the commission advises residents to stand their ground and fight back with anything at hand, as it is not unheard of for attacking black bears to be warded off in such a manner.

EN_199	1	Kansas Governor's Veto of Transgender Sports Ban Upheld by State Lawmakers
EN_199	2	Legislation banning transgender student athletes from girls' sports in Kansas has again been blocked after legislators couldn't muster enough votes to overcome the governor's veto of the controversial bill.
EN_199	3	The Kansas House on Thursday voted 81-41 to override Governor Laura Kelly's veto of the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, falling just shy of the 84 votes needed to meet the two-thirds override threshold.
EN_199	4	The vote was a rare victory for opponents of the legislation after more than a dozen Republican-leaning states enacted similar bans.
EN_199	5	"""Compassion wins today,"" Democratic state Representative Brandon Woodard, Kansas' first openly gay legislator, wrote on The legislation, Senate Bill 16, would have barred ""students of the male sex"" from playing on public school and college sports teams designated for women or girls."
EN_199	6	Proponents of the bill have described it as fairness measure, preventing athletes born biologically male to have an advantage in women's sports.
EN_199	7	"Kelly vetoed the bill earlier this month, saying in a statement that it ""didn't come from the experts at our schools, our athletes, or the Kansas State High School Activities Association."
EN_199	8	"It came from politicians trying to score political points."""
EN_199	9	Kansas lawmakers have upheld the governor's veto of controversial legislation that would have banned transgender student athletes from competing in girls' sports.

EN_199	12	The Kansas Senate voted to override the veto earlier this week, but there wasn't enough support in the House.
EN_199	13	"""The case has already been convincingly made by doctors, scientists, professional athletes that women need a category in nearly every sport to compete with fairness,"" state Representative Susan Humphries said during the debate Thursday."
EN_199	14	"""Fairness is what this bill is about."""
EN_199	15	But Democratic state Representative Stephanie Byers, the first openly transgender person elected to the Kansas Legislature, said in a speech on Thursday the bill was crafted with bad information and wasn't written with fairness or athletics in mind.
EN_199	16	"She said there is ""maybe one trans girl in all of Kansas that is trying to participate in athletics."""
EN_199	17	"""If this is about athletics, then we address the Kansas State High School Activities Association's policy, and we sit down and say, 'how can we fine-tune this to make this more fair?'"""
EN_199	18	said Byers.
EN_199	19	"""If this is about fairness, then what is the policy and the procedure for a trans girl to sit down and say, 'I have the right because I don't possess any type of biological advantage'?"""
EN_199	20	Fifteen Republican-led states have passed restrictions on transgender athletes, according to the Movement Advancement Project.
EN_199	21	But a handful of Republican governors have vetoed similar bills.
EN_199	22	Indiana's Republican Governor Eric Holcomb nixed his state's bill, saying there wasn't enough evidence to justify it.
EN_199	23	Legislative are eyeing a veto override.
EN_199	24	Utah Governor Spencer Cox followed suit, saying it would single out and stigmatize the state's four transgender kids participating in school sports.
EN_199	25	The Legislature later overrode his veto.
EN_199	26	Last year, Arkansas GOP Governor Asa Hutchinson vetoed a ban , but it was later overridden by the Legislature.

EN_209	1	'Pristine' Reef Discovered Off Coast of Tahiti Described as One of Largest in World
EN_209	2	The discovery of one of the largest coral reefs in the world off the coast of Tahiti is offering promise on the future of coral reefs and conservation.
EN_209	3	the discovery, part of a scientific mission supported by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is valuable for multiple reasons, according to the organization.
EN_209	4	It consists of a large area approximately 3 kilometers in length and between 30-65 meters wide.
EN_209	5	Rose-shaped corals found at the site are up to 2 meters in diameter.
EN_209	6	It is also noted as an important revelation due to the depth of the discovered reef.
EN_209	7	"It was located between 30 and 65 meters deep, which researchers said is ""highly unusual"" because the vast majority of the world's known coral reefs are located no deeper than 25 meters."
EN_209	8	"This means that there may be a plethora of unknown reefs in water bodies that extend deeper than 30 meters, in what researchers call the ocean's ""twilight zone."""
EN_209	9	"""To date, we know the surface of the moon better than the deep ocean,"" said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay."
EN_209	10	"""Only 20 percent of the entire seabed has been mapped."
EN_209	11	"This remarkable discovery in Tahiti demonstrates the incredible work of scientists who, with the support of UNESCO, further the extent of our knowledge about what lies beneath."""
EN_209	12	"Researchers recently discovered one of the largest ""pristine"" coral reefs off the coast of Tahiti."

EN_209	16	Annually until 2030, expeditions are being executed across oceans to find new threats while being better prepared to solve real-time and future issues.
EN_209	17	"""It was magical to witness giant, beautiful rose corals which stretch for as far as the eye can see,"" said Rosenfeld, who photographed the experience."
EN_209	18	"""It was like a work of art."""
EN_209	19	Coral reefs are an important food source for other organisms, UNESCO said, so new discoveries aid biodiversity research.
EN_209	20	Organisms that live on reefs can be integral for medicinal research, while the reefs themselves can provide protection from coastal erosion and even tsunamis.
EN_209	21	Dr. Laetitia Hedouin, of France's National Center of Scientific Research, said that although French Polynesia suffered a significant bleaching event in 2019, this newly discovered reef does not seem to be significantly affected.
EN_209	22	"""The discovery of this reef in such a pristine condition is good news and can inspire future conservation,"" she said."

EN_210	1	Human trafficking and money laundering
EN_210	2	Apart from the geopolitical games, Abbot Bartholomew also decries the Russians’ criminal activities.
EN_210	3	“We told the Greek authorities about the illegal use of the speedboats, which – in contrast to the other boats – were never controlled by the coastguard,” he tells BILD.
EN_210	4	“The harbourmaster always told the occupiers when the coast guard’s boats were on patrol or otherwise deployed. (…) After the police had arrested the regional coast guard’s senior official, several women were brought ashore.
EN_210	5	If I remember correctly, they came from Ukraine …,” Abbot Bartholomew continues.
EN_210	6	The suspicion is that these women were brought ashore by a trafficker’s boat and left there after the official’s arrest.
EN_210	7	The oligarchs’ business centre.
EN_210	8	Christos, an informant ( name changed, ed. ) confirmed to BILD that the incident with the coast guard Commander and the trafficking actually took place.
EN_210	9	He knows even more: “One of his closest members of staff (…) has disappeared after the arrest and now owns a bar in Germany.”
EN_210	10	Christos also confirmed to BILD that an oligarch knew about Putin’s invasion of Ukraine when he visited the monastery and prepared the monks for it.
EN_210	11	He says: “Mount Athos is a holy place, and they made it their business centre.
EN_210	12	Russian oligarchs and government elites kept arriving in Thessaloniki.
EN_210	13	While their wives and children spent their holidays in the Chalkidiki resorts in the Aegean, the men travelled to Athos.”
EN_210	14	According to Christos, the reason is: “In the religious surroundings, it is safe for them to have discussions or to do what they want.”
EN_210	15	Greek authorities investigate criminals.
EN_210	16	Many of the “guests” on Athos have been sanctioned by the West because of the war on Ukraine.
EN_210	17	This is hardly a coincidence.
EN_210	18	The main activity of many of the Russians on Athos is money laundering.
EN_210	19	A Greek official, who agreed to talk to BILD anonymously, describes the Russian money laundering as “babushka”: “We know how the money has arrived, but we don’t know how it has disappeared.
EN_210	20	But we will find it.
EN_210	21	We have a list of persons who are investigated.
EN_210	22	Of course, this also includes persons belonging to the Church.”
EN_210	23	“The problem with Athos is that we have limited access to the place due to is holy nature.
EN_210	24	We cannot even monitor the telecommunications – not even the Americans can,” the official says.
EN_210	25	Secret report details criminal activities.
EN_210	26	BILD has seen a secret report by the Greek authorities that gives the names of well-known Russians who have visited Athos; their connections to Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin; which monasteries they made donations to; and which roles the Abbots of these monasteries played.
EN_210	27	The report also lists the monasteries that are investigated by the authorities.
EN_210	28	BILD has seen the list, but cannot make it public as long as the investigation continues. ► The conclusion of the report: “The Kremlin capitalizes on the common (Christian-Orthodox) religion.
EN_210	29	In order to achieve its goals, it uses civil servants and oligarchs who try to strengthen the Russian presence via donations to the monasteries and support for certain Abbots and other Orthodox leaders.”
EN_210	30	Putin’s visit to Mount Athos.
EN_210	31	Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin has strengthened the Russian presence on Mount Athos with his repeated visits.
EN_210	32	And not only that: he was accompanied by Konstantin Malofeev, a Russian particularly active on Athos.
EN_210	33	He is currently on the EU’s and US’s sanction lists because he allegedly finances the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
EN_210	34	Abbot Bartholomew tells BILD: “On his own TV channel, Malofeev said that the moment when Putin set foot on Athos in 2016 was blessed.”

EN_214	1	Ron DeSantis Favorite for Re-Election Despite Recent Controversies: Poll
EN_214	2	Florida Governor Ron DeSantis leads his Democratic challenger in his re-election bid despite facing several controversies in recent weeks, according to a new poll.
EN_214	3	DeSantis, a Republican first elected to the governorship in 2018, has emerged as a national figure in the Republican Party, with many speculating that he could be a possible presidential candidate.
EN_214	4	He is up for re-election this year, in what could be a test of his popularity ahead of the 2024 presidential election.
EN_214	5	A Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy poll released Monday showed him securing at least 50 percent against each of his rivals in the key swing state of Florida.
EN_214	6	He holds an 8-point lead against Representative Charlie Cristwho previously served as governor from 2007 to 2011 as a Republican.
EN_214	7	He holds an 11-point lead against Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, and a 16-point lead against State Senator Annette Taddeo, the poll found.
EN_214	8	Within the Democratic primary, Crist remains the favorite, securing 44 percent of the vote to Fried's 27 percent and Taddeo's 3 percent, according to the poll, which surveyed 625 Florida voters from February 7 to 10 by both cell phone and landline phones.
EN_214	9	It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points.
EN_214	10	DeSantis' strong polling numbers follow weeks of controversy for the governor.
EN_214	11	"He has faced criticism from LGBTQ advocates over legislation that would require schools to notify parents if their child was given services regarding their ""mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being"" and only discussing sexual orientation and gender identity with students who are ""age-appropriate."""

EN_217	1	Donald Trump to hold first rally of 2024 presidential campaign in Waco
EN_217	2	In 1993, an attempted raid by law enforcement officials at a compound belonging to the Branch Davidians, a religious cult, resulted in a shootout that led to a 51-day siege, ending in a blaze that left dozens dead.
EN_217	3	The rally comes as Mr Trump has berated prosecutors, encouraged protests and raised the prospect of possible violence should he become the first former president in US history to face criminal charges.
EN_217	4	Supporters of Donald Trump gather near an airport in Waco ahead of the first rally of his 2024 campaign (Julio Cortez/AP) Some of his recent rhetoric has echoed language he used before the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol in 2021 by a mob of his supporters seeking to stop the transfer of power.
EN_217	5	“What kind of person can charge another person, in this case a former President of the United States… and leading candidate (by far!)
EN_217	6	for the Republican Party nomination, with a Crime, when it is known by all that NO Crime has been committed, & also known that potential death & destruction in such a false charge could be catastrophic for our Country?”
EN_217	7	Mr Trump wrote on his social media site on Friday.
EN_217	8	Mr Trump’s campaign insisted the location and timing of the event had nothing to do with the Waco siege or anniversary.
EN_217	9	Instead, a spokesperson said the site was chosen because it was conveniently situated near four of the state’s biggest metropolitan areas – Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio – and has the infrastructure to handle a sizable crowd.
EN_217	10	“This is the ideal location to have as many supporters from across the state and in neighbouring states attend this historic rally,” said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung.
EN_217	11	The city is part of McLennan County, which Mr Trump won in 2020 by more than 23 points.
EN_217	12	The airport where the rally is being held is 17 miles from the Branch Davidian compound.
EN_217	13	Rick Frazier, of Ohio, holds a large flag in Waco ahead of Donald Trump’s campaign rally (Julio Cortez/AP) The rally had already been in the works before it became clear that a grand jury in New York was drawing closer to a possible indictment as it investigates hush money payments made to women who alleged sexual encounters with Mr Trump during the height of his 2016 campaign.
EN_217	14	Mr Trump has denied the women’s claims.
EN_217	15	But the timing will give Mr Trump an opportunity to demonstrate his continued popularity with the Republican base and to portray himself as the victim of a politically motivated “witch hunt” as he campaigns for a second term in the White House.
EN_217	16	The grand jury is expected to meet again on Monday in New York.
EN_217	17	Mr Trump has spent weeks complaining about the investigation.
EN_217	18	In a move that seemed designed to pre-empt a formal announcement and to galvanise his loyal base, he claimed last Saturday that he would be arrested the following Tuesday.
EN_217	19	While that did not happen, Mr Trump has used the days since to try to shape public perception, claiming, for instance, that the Manhattan district attorney’s office had plunged into “total disarray”, though there was no evidence to suggest prosecutors were backing away from the case.
EN_217	20	His efforts echoed a strategy the former president has used before, including during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.
EN_234	1	US and China continue to fight for Ukrainian defense plant
EN_234	2	After 2014, Ukraine stopped all forms of military-technical cooperation with Russia.
EN_234	3	The company stopped deliveries to Russia of aircraft and gas turbine engines for cruise missiles, stopped servicing equipment and lost its main customer.
EN_234	4	This led to significant financial difficulties.
EN_234	5	Therefore, the Motor Sich management was forced to look for new sources of financing.
EN_234	6	In 2018, more than half of Motor Sich’s shares were sold to a private Chinese company.
EN_234	7	But the country’s leadership accused the President of Motor Sich of trying to move the plant’s capacities abroad.
EN_234	8	The court seized the deal.
EN_234	9	However, the capacities of the Ukrainian plant are hardly of interest to China.
EN_234	10	But technology – yes.
EN_234	11	As well as a unique scientific base, accumulated over decades of activity in the development of aircraft engines.
EN_234	12	The start of joint cooperation with Motor Sich would allow China to obtain technologies for the construction of engines of the fourth or fifth generations.
EN_234	13	Beijing is currently unsuccessfully trying to create an engine for the J-20 aircraft.
EN_234	14	Therefore, Russian units are temporarily used.
EN_234	15	The economic and technical capabilities of China make it possible to quickly establish mass production of engines.
EN_234	16	Which will lead to the inevitable growth of the aviation and helicopter industry.
EN_234	17	Currently, this market is completely controlled by the United States.
EN_234	18	And they obviously do not want to admit their main competitor to it.
EN_234	19	Therefore, it is likely that the ban on the sale of Motor Sich shares to the Chinese was dictated from Washington.
EN_234	20	Although, from the economic point of view, Motor Sich is of no interest to the United States.
EN_234	21	But Beijing’s plans to create a competitor to the American Boeing company are seriously feared in Washington.
EN_234	22	This would give China not only independence from American aircraft technology, but also an additional stimulus for economic growth.
EN_234	23	Currently, the advantage in aircraft construction is used by the United States as one of the political levers.
EN_234	24	China is trying to diversify production and avoid dependence in this area.
EN_234	25	Americans don’t want that.
EN_234	26	A month ago, a Ukrainian court seized Motor Sich shares for the second time.
EN_234	27	A criminal case was initiated under the article “high treason”.
EN_234	28	The deal has been postponed again.
EN_234	29	It turns out that the Ukrainian company is becoming a victim of political showdowns between China and the United States.
EN_234	30	Which became hostage to a dispute between two third-party states.
EN_234	31	Washington issues instructions to Ukrainian courts.
EN_234	32	If necessary, the deal will be blocked for the third, fourth time … China files an appeal.
EN_234	33	And time goes by.
EN_234	34	The company’s assets are in limbo.
EN_234	35	And all this negatively affects the country’s economy.
EN_234	36	Even if the deal with the sale of shares can be settled, the Ukrainian company will not receive any benefits.
EN_234	37	The proceeds will probably go straight away to pay off loans accumulated over the period of downtime.
EN_235	1	On The Cusp Of An Economic Singularity
EN_235	2	The simple truth of a singularity applies whether it occurred in the past or will in the future: what transpires on the other side is unknowable from here.
EN_235	3	Given the horrific and still-unfolding events of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the West’s collective response to it, one can’t help but wonder whether we are on the cusp of an economic singularity in which the laws and bedrock beliefs that formed the foundation of international economic order for decades break down.
EN_235	4	The consequences are similarly unknowable, but we suspect a great reset may indeed be upon us.
EN_235	5	Even if a ceasefire is announced moments after we publish this piece, shocking damage to the global economic system has undoubtedly already been done and certain genies won’t easily be put back into their bottles.
EN_235	6	Before proceeding, we should state clearly that what follows is not a critique of the Western response to the invasion but rather an assessment of the potential first- and second-order consequences of these historic moves, as well as speculation on where some of the harshest economic crises might manifest in the near future.
EN_235	7	While we join in the hope that these measures achieve their desired direct effect, there’s no denying these are truly unprecedented times.
EN_235	8	The most stunning move by the US and its allies was cutting off the Russian central bank’s access to most of its $630 billion of foreign reserves.
EN_235	9	Without access, one wonders if these funds are really “its” reserves at all?
EN_235	10	What is ownership without access?
EN_235	11	No matter how justified that move might seem today, there’s no escaping that this action will reverberate for years to come.
EN_235	12	In a blunt opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled “ If Russian Currency Reserves Aren’t Really Money, the World Is in for a Shock,” reporter Jon Sindreu had this to say about how central banks everywhere must now view their reserves:
EN_235	13	Many economists have long equated this money to savings in a piggy bank, which in turn correspond to investments made abroad in the real economy.
EN_235	14	Recent events highlight the error in this thinking: Barring gold, these assets are someone else’s liability—someone who can just decide they are worth nothing .
EN_235	15	Last year, the IMF suspended Taliban-controlled Afghanistan’s access to funds and SDR.
EN_235	16	Sanctions on Iran have confirmed that holding reserves offshore doesn’t stop the U.S.
EN_235	17	Treasury from taking action.

EN_236	1	Editorial To Vima: Resounding warning signals
EN_236	2	It was unavoidable that the European Commission’s report on the Greek economy would not be rosy.
EN_236	3	On the one hand it acknowledged that Greece has made progress in meeting its commitments, but on the other it notes a series of delays and problems that are fraught with dangers.
EN_236	4	The most serious objections and concerns pertained to the law that will replace the so-called Katseli law which protected debtors’ primary homes from foreclosure under strict conditions.
EN_236	5	Another point of contention was the government’s plan to allow taxpayers to pay debts to the tax bureau or insurance funds in 120 instalments.
EN_236	6	Also, there was consternation regarding the tender on the privatisation of the Public Power Corporation’s lignite plants and there were concerns that judicial rulings ordering that amounts cut from pensions be returned to retirees could derail Greece’s fiscal recovery.
EN_236	7	It is obvious that the government’s room for manoeuvre is limited if it wants to receive a tranche of about one billion euros from the profits of eurozone central banks on Greek bonds.
EN_236	8	Above all, it must avoid a negative climate ahead of Greece’s return to the markets.
EN_236	9	That is why a meeting was held with bankers yesterday at the PM’s Maximos Mansion offices so as to refashion a protection net that will shield debtors’ primary residence from foreclosure.
EN_236	10	We shall see in the coming days whether the agreement between Greek banks and the government will address the Commission’s concerns.
EN_236	11	It should be noted that the government is constantly cultivating expectations among hundreds of thousands of citizens who owe to the tax bureau and insurance funds.
EN_236	12	The report said that the European institutions overseeing the Greek economy were informed by the government that it “does not intend in the near future to revise debt settlement arrangements governing tax and insurance debts”.
EN_236	13	We shall likely see what the government truly intends to do in the Commission’s next briefing.
EN_236	14	The Commission’s report highlights the fact that the governmental narrative that after the completion of the memorandum Greece arranges its affairs on its own is completely false.
EN_236	15	Any decision with serious economic repercussions must be reviewed and approved by European institutions.
EN_236	16	The progress report and the study of macroeconomic balances demonstrate that the economy remains exceptionally vulnerable.The high level of public debt, non-performing loans, unemployment, the aging of the population, and the migration issue, are undermining the very foundations of the economy.
EN_236	17	These warning signs are aggravated by a pre-electoral climate.
EN_236	18	Polarising clashes and opportunistic, petty partisan objectives are once again threatening to undermine anything positive that has been achieved over the last years.
EN_236	19	It may well be that it will again be demonstrated that the country’s problems are not primarily economic, but instead political.

EN_251	2	Distance learning will continue until January 25 in Harju and Ida-Viru Counties, th worst-affected regions.
EN_251	3	In the rest of Estonia, children with some exceptions are welcomed at school.
EN_251	4	Deputy Secretary General (Secondary and Adult Education) Robert Lippin said that he understands the worries of the parents who would keep their children at home, but emphasized that if possible, children should still participate in contact learning.
EN_251	5	"""If the parent makes a decision to not send his or her child to school, whatever the reason, fear of the virus, a domestic situation, then the parent doesn't have the right to demand a parallel system from the school to teach children studying both at home and at school,"" Lippin said."
EN_251	6	"""It is definitely not possible for the teacher to do two parallel systems because there is a limited amount of hours in a day."""
EN_251	7	Lippin added that if the school is able to offer distance learning, it is welcomed.
EN_251	8	Even if the student has to isolate himself as close contact, the school is not obligated to offer contact learning.
EN_251	9	"""If the close class is on distance learning due to the spread of the virus, then the schools have to organize the teaching from distance."
EN_251	10	"If somebody has stayed home due to being sick or close contact, then the teachers and schools can't be forced to do it."""
EN_251	11	Tartu Kivilinn school's principal Karin Lukk said that they have five students who are not participating due to the wish of their parents.
EN_251	12	Lukk said that they have been able to convince the worried parents or if really needed, offer distance learning.
EN_251	13	"""Of course, the more there will be students like this, the more complicated it will be because the more distinctions would have to be done."
EN_251	14	"If there will be more cases we have to look at every case separately on how to give the permit,"" Lukk said."
EN_251	15	"""Maybe it would be possible to talk to the family and decrease those fears and the child can still go to school if we help them."
EN_251	16	"It all requires considering each child separately."""
EN_251	17	Jaan Poska High School principal Helmer Jõgi said that when a student is ready for independent work, the school should find a solution.
EN_251	18	"""If it's done officially by the parent, why not?"
EN_251	19	The school can't be against it.
EN_251	20	It also means that the student has a bigger responsibility compared to studying in the class or being on distance learning with the whole class.
EN_251	21	"There the school is obligated to offer quality teaching."""

EN_268	1	Coronavirus has Mutated, Iran attacked by a Different Strain from Wuhan
EN_268	2	During a recent segment on the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19), a CNBC commentator explained that the strain currently circulating in Iran is different than the one that originated in Wuhan.
EN_268	3	A clip of the segment that was shared to Twitter by Disclose.tv shows the commentator explaining how the situation has changed now that the novel disease appears to be mutating.
EN_268	4	“At the end of the day, we don’t have any solutions, we don’t have any cures, we don’t have any vaccines.
EN_268	5	And this virus is morphing,” he’s heard stating.
EN_268	6	“There’s a report out today that the coronavirus cases found in Iran are a different strain, and they did not come out of China.
EN_268	7	So, that can be troubling if that proves to be true.”
EN_268	8	Some of the latest reports out of Iran reveal that schools are closing, hospitals are filling up, and chemicals are being sprayed in subways as the number of cases in the Middle Eastern country skyrocket.
EN_268	9	As it turns out, the earliest known cases in Iran of this particular strain of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) were in people that hadn’t even traveled to China, suggesting that it started some other way that authorities have yet to determine.
EN_268	10	According to reports, the Iranian government has designated at least 230 hospitals across the country as treatment centers for the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19).
EN_268	11	There are also 14 provinces where all cultural events, including soccer matches, have been put on hiatus.
EN_268	12	“In every city, one hospital will be dedicated to treating coronavirus cases,” stated Iranian Health Minister Saeed Namaki, adding that there would be more designated hospitals in the larger cities.
EN_268	13	Listen below as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how mass government incompetence is causing the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) to spread faster than it should: If more infections emerge, entire city of Tehran with nine million people will be locked down.
EN_268	14	The city of Tehran, Iran’s capital, is also starting to look like Wuhan with mass transit shutting down and disinfecting teams roving the city spraying chemicals.
EN_268	15	And if the situation gets any worse with more new cases, officials say they plan to shut Tehran down completely, putting about nine million people under mandatory quarantine.
EN_268	16	As of this writing, the number of coronavirus infections in Iran has breached 60, with at least 12 deaths.
EN_268	17	However, one lawmaker from the city of Qom told the media that at least 50 people have died from the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) in that city alone.
EN_268	18	“The rest of the media have not published this figure, but we prefer not to censor what concerns the coronavirus because people’s lives are in danger,” reported the semi-official news outlet ILNA.
EN_268	19	The Iranian government, meanwhile, has rejected this figure.
EN_268	20	Health Minister Iraj Harirchi announced on state television that this claim of at least 50 deaths in Qom is “categorically” false.
EN_268	21	Pakistan, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Kuwait, meanwhile, all of which border Iran, have shut down either all or some of their crossing points with the country in an effort to keep the disease from spreading outside its borders.
EN_268	22	“If a virus mutates then there is no possible way to develop a vaccine,” wrote one Twitter user in response to the news that the Iranian variety of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) is different than the one spreading in Wuhan.
EN_268	23	“Nice knowing all of you…” “I personally think there is more to it,” wrote another.
EN_268	24	“No one at all is talking about how some blood groups are going to be more susceptible to it.
EN_268	25	I have done a ton of research and can tell you for a fact that some blood types are more susceptible to, for instance, HIV virus and others.”

EN_272	30	"""But what they don't realize is that I'm willing to go lose everything, job, paycheck, freedom, even my life for this cause."
EN_272	31	Be well.

EN_272	33	California's health care workers were required to get at least their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by September 30.

EN_275	4	"Explained the 43-year-old to the news site: ""Dad went to hospital on July 6 for kidney stones, we think he picked COVID up there."
EN_275	5	"On Thursday, July 8, my parents had dinner at my brother's apartment he shares with his girlfriend and they started to feel very ill that weekend."""
EN_275	6	By July 10, Goncalves' parents, Basil, 73, and Charmagne, 65, had been admitted to a hospital.
EN_275	7	Two days later, Basil was sent to the ICU.
EN_275	8	As Goncalves prepared to fly to Portugal amid travel restrictions, he struggled to keep in touch with his family.
EN_275	9	"""I spoke to my brother every day and we couldn't get hold of my father....It was very difficult for me to get hold of him in a country [where] I couldn't speak the language,"" he explained."

EN_275	11	"""From then, he deteriorated and when I managed to speak to him, I could tell there was definitely something wrong with him."""
EN_275	12	By July 18, at around 1 a.m., Goncalves' brother, Shaul, had passed away.

EN_278	2	Reporting Most Deaths More than 4 million cases of the novel coronavirus have now been diagnosed worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
EN_278	3	The education and research institution, which updates its digital tracker cataloging global COVID-19 figures at least twice daily, initially reported the number on Saturday, totaling individual case counts from 187 countries and regions across the globe confronting ramifications of the pandemic.
EN_278	4	The tracker indicated that at least 50,000 additional cases were identified by Sunday morning.
EN_278	5	More than 50 percent of cases detected since the virus first emerged last December were currently active on Sunday, the university's statistics showed.
EN_278	6	Of roughly 4.05 million people who contracted the illness overall, about 1.38 million had recovered, while nearly 280,000 had died.
EN_278	7	Those calculations suggested close to 2.4 million people were still infected worldwide, with the United States reporting the highest incidence of cases as well as resulting fatalities.
EN_278	8	The U.S. became the new coronavirus pandemic's global epicenter at the end of March, when the number of cases confirmed nationwide surpassed those separately confirmed by Italy and China, which had previously reported the world's highest- and second-highest case counts.
EN_278	9	At the time, at least 92,000 people had tested positive for the disease across a handful of U.S. states, more than 1,200 of whom had died.
EN_278	10	As Newsweek reported on March 27, the U.S. had recently seen a surge in diagnoses, having confirmed more than 50,000 positive cases over the three-week period following its 100th diagnosis.
EN_278	11	The data, originally published by The Financial Times , pointed to a forthcoming outbreak curve more severe than those experienced in any other affected country.
EN_278	12	The U.S. reported the world's highest number of deaths due to the virus several weeks later, in mid-April, and continues to report more fatalities than any nation worldwide.
EN_278	13	As of Sunday morning, more than 1.3 million cases of the new coronavirus had been confirmed, with at least 78,855 deaths and 212,534 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University's tracker.
EN_278	14	New York has experienced the gravest outbreak compared to any U.S. state.
EN_278	15	About 25 percent of cases diagnosed nationwide have been confirmed in New York, as have more than 30 percent of deaths.
EN_278	16	New Yorkers are pictured walking through Manhattan while wearing masks on May 9.
EN_278	17	New York has diagnosed the highest number of cases and deaths related to the new coronavirus compared to any U.S. state.
EN_278	18	Globally, the U.S. has reported significantly more positive cases and resulting fatalities than all other countries affected by the pandemic.

EN_278	20	Though U.S. cases and subsequent fatalities account for roughly one-third of global totals in both respects, additional analysis included in the university's online coronavirus resource center has noted that the country's observed case-fatality ratio is lower than others that have experienced significant outbreaks.
EN_278	21	The populations of those countries—like the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium and Germany—are much smaller than that of the U.S.
EN_278	22	Government officials across the globe, as well as within the U.S., have responded to downward trends in new diagnoses, hospitalizations and deaths related to the new coronavirus recorded in recent weeks.
EN_278	23	Many national and local administrations have begun to lift stay-at-home orders and non-essential business closures imposed at the pandemic's onset, or intend to do so in the coming weeks.
EN_278	24	Several U.S. states have launched reopening procedures—although those hardest hit, for the most part, remain closed.

EN_287	9	“This is good news and gives all of us great hope.
EN_287	10	However, even if you have received your Covid-19 vaccine, you must continue to wash your hands, wear a face covering, maintain a social distance and keep your close contacts to a minimum.
EN_287	11	Until we have all been vaccinated, we must act as though none of us have been vaccinated,” Dr Holohan said.
EN_287	12	It was confirmed yesterday that over 70s will receive mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna “where practicable and timely”.

EN_287	16	“We are noticing a clear pattern in people with symptoms delaying contacting their GP to arrange a test.
EN_287	17	It is vital that as soon as you notice that you have symptoms of COVID-19 that you isolate and contact your GP immediately.
EN_287	18	By acting quickly, we can prevent the spread of Covid-19 and protect our vulnerable loved ones.”
EN_287	19	Professor Philip Nolan, the chair of the NPHET Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, said the next few weeks will be “difficult for all of us”.
EN_287	20	“As we bring the daily case levels below 1,000 per day, our progress will seem to slow down,” Professor Nolan said.
EN_287	21	“It is now more important than ever that we continue our efforts to bring case numbers down towards the very low levels we achieved in June and July.
EN_287	22	In that regard, it is very good news that our estimates of the R number are well below one – in the region of 0.5 – 0.8.” - With reporting by Sean Murray

EN_292	5	Those aged 16 to 39 who received a Janssen vaccine as their primary vaccine can be offered a booster dose irrespective of their age after a minimum three-month interval.
EN_292	6	Speaking on RTÉ’s News at One , chair of the Irish Medical Organisation’s GP committee Dr Denis McCauley said GPs had been asked to try “as much as we can” to give as many boosters as possible over the next four weeks.
EN_292	7	“We’re not going to get involved with routine care, we’ll try as much as possible on each day to try and deal with urgent cases but we’re going to be primarily directing ourselves with rolling out the booster campaign,” he said.
EN_292	8	He said GPs “are really tired but very willing” to step up to administer boosters, and urged the public to “please bear with us” over the next number of weeks.
EN_292	9	He also urged the public to put receiving a booster “on your Christmas list”, saying it’s the best way people can protect themselves and the rest of the country.
EN_292	10	Speaking to Morning Ireland , Mary Favier, Covid advisor to the Irish College of General Practitioners, said that GPs will be working to double the number of booster vaccines they will administer in the coming weeks, but this will be at the expense of normal GP services.
EN_292	11	“GPs are delivering a significant number of booster vaccinations already, between 75,000 and 85,000 a week, but we’re now going to try and double that in the next one, two and three weeks with an all-out push to put booster jabs in people’s arms,” she said.
EN_292	12	When asked whether or people should visit GPs, Favier said that they should evaluate whether or not it could wait until the New Year, but that people should not ignore significant or worrying concerns.
EN_292	13	“We would ask people not to ignore significant things, not to ignore worrying concerns, to still make contact.
EN_292	14	We might then talk to you, triage it and put it off until the new year.
EN_292	15	“GPs will be trying to do a lot of this vaccination during routine hours, but we’ll be doing out of hours, we’ll be doing weekends.”
EN_292	16	“It’s going to put a significant surge into the out of hours services, like the on-call services and unfortunately into the emergency departments… if in doubt, seek advice.”

EN_294	3	HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE warned the situation in hospitals is now “extremely high risk” as the system approaches the limit of its critical care surge capacity.
EN_294	4	There are 211 people with Covid-19 in Irish intensive care units and a further 330 patients are receiving advanced respiratory support on wards outside of an ICU.
EN_294	5	Almost 20% of all hospital beds are occupied by Covid-19 patients.
EN_294	6	Speaking to the Oireachtas Health Committee this morning, Dr Vida Hamilton, national clinical advisor and group lead, acute hospitals, said now that hospitals are at surge capacity they had to “deploy different methods of staffing” to ensure the best care.
EN_294	7	“Our critical care nurse escalation plan is in place.
EN_294	8	We trained over 1,600 non-critical care staff to support critical care services,” she said.
EN_294	9	“We deployed them initially in a one-to-one ratio, working directly with a critical care nurse in a buddy arrangement in the first instance.
EN_294	10	“Then as we entered surge, we had one critical care nurse supervising two and then three non-critical care nurses, but maintaining a nurse-patient ratio of one-to-one for optimal safety.”
EN_294	11	She said there is daily contact with staff and monitoring of the situation in each hospital.
EN_294	12	“Is the care of the same standard?
EN_294	13	No,” she added.
EN_294	14	Also addressing the committee, the HSE’s Liam Woods said that there are currently over 6,500 health workers on sick leave in acute hospitals.
EN_294	15	He said 2,500 are nurses and 600 are patient-facing administration staff.
EN_294	16	Woods said the situation in hospitals now is different and “even more challenging”, in part due to the increased transmissibility of the virus.
EN_294	17	“Clearly in a system where we have significant staff absences and very significant surge and high community infection we are concerned about risk,” Woods said.
EN_294	18	“We are working and staff across the system are working to mitigate that risk but it would be unrealistic to expect the same outcomes as in previous times.”
EN_294	19	Currently there are 500 vacant beds in the hospital system primarily due to staffing.
EN_294	20	‘Battling hard in hospitals’ “We’ve never seen 66% of patients in ICU (211) being treated for the same illness.
EN_294	21	We’re battling hard to sustain safe levels of care, but its getting harder,” HSE CEO Paul Reid There were a further 2,608 cases of Covid-19 reported , and 51 deaths. yesterday Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, Paul Reid said that something is “very different” about the level of transmission and the number of cases.
EN_294	22	Responding to the statistic that third of patients contracted Covid-19 while in hospital, Reid said that healthcare systems are “extremely exposed” to the levels of Covid-19 in the community, and it’s impossible to put a “ring of steel” around our healthcare system.
EN_294	23	On the vaccine, Reid said that if the AstraZeneca vaccine is approved, there will be “1 million deliveries per month from April/May onwards”.
EN_294	24	“All the data is predicated on a huge, huge level of assumptions that we hope come true.”
EN_294	25	Responding to lobbying groups’ requests to be moved up the priority list for the vaccine, Reid said that he understands the call from people asking to get the vaccine sooner, but said that it will be guided by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee – and not politicians.
EN_294	26	Mandatory quarantine.
EN_294	27	Several members of the Oireachtas Health Committee this morning questioned Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn on the need to implement a mandatory quarantine on those arriving into the country.
EN_294	28	He said travel imposes a very significant risk to the suppression of the disease in Ireland.
EN_294	29	“NPHET is in favour of avoiding all non-essential travel in the first instance, that’s the most important measure.
EN_294	30	And beyond that, our advice is there, it’s published, we’ve preciously asked for mandatory quarantine and recently we asked for any element of discretion as it applies to travel to be removed insofar as is possible,” he told the committee members.
EN_294	31	“But we’re not the experts on what’s possible.
EN_294	32	What we want is a situation is where non-essential travel is reduced to the greatest extend possible through whatever means are required.”
EN_302	1	Police: Cocaine sales have increased significantly
EN_302	2	Throughout Europe, drug trafficking is on the rise, and cocaine sales have increased significantly.
EN_302	3	According to Europol data, there have never been as many coca plantations worldwide as there are today.
EN_302	4	"As a result, the narcotic that had previously been known as the ""rich man's drug"" has finally become affordable in Estonia as well."
EN_302	5	Increasing drug trafficking has made narcotics more affordable, and access to them is easier than before thanks to the internet age, reported ETV news broadcast Aktuaalne kaamera.
EN_302	6	Ago Leis, director of the Organized Crime Department of the Central Criminal Police, said that European trends are Estonian trends as well.
EN_302	7	"""The influence arrives with a certain delay, but looking at the latest Europol narcotics report, the quantities of seized marijuana and cocaine are on the rise,"" he said."
EN_302	8	As the drug trade is the most profitable criminal business in the world, criminal organizations are very interested in increasing narcotics production, Leis said.
EN_302	9	Thus marijuana growing has increased in Africa, while several new coca plantations have been established in South America in recent years.
EN_302	10	Major countries' drug markets are oversaturated, leaving sellers to seek buyers elsewhere, such as in Estonia.
EN_302	11	Cocaine's street price in Estonia has remained by and large the same, however the drug itself is several times more potent than it used to be.
EN_302	12	"""Recent years' cocaine seizures have been very pure, with purities of over 90 percent, and we have noticed that the number of users is also somewhat increasing,"" Leis noted."
EN_302	13	"While cocaine was previously considered the ""rich man's drug,"" by now it can be found at regular parties, festivals and bars, he added."
EN_302	14	Tax and Customs Board (MTA) Narcotics Division director Raul Koppelmaa said that the customs authority seized some 15 kilograms of cocaine last year, the biggest amount yet in recent years.
EN_302	15	"""But our target isn't amounts, but rather the people behind them as well,"" he said."
EN_302	16	According to Koppelmaa, Estonia remains a transit country for narcotics from the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium heading toward Russia and Scandinavia.
EN_302	17	"""We're seeing a great deal of the direction of a lot of amphetamine being taken to Finland,"" he said."
EN_302	18	"""Last year, we seized some 100 kilograms of amphetamine en route to the Finnish market."""
EN_302	19	Also likewise increasing in popularity in Estonia in recent years is ordering narcotics on the dark web, primarily for personal use.
EN_303	1	Chinese pharma company Sinovac 'confident' of vaccine safety after Brazil trial halted
EN_303	2	CHINESE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM
EN_303	3	Sinovac Biotech is standing by the safety of its Covid-19 vaccine after Brazilian regulators halted trials in the South American country citing an “adverse incident” involving a volunteer recipient.
EN_303	4	Yesterday Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa said it had suspended clinical trials pf the vaccine.
EN_303	5	It said it could not give details on what happened because of privacy regulations.
EN_303	6	The public health centre coordinating the trials of the vaccine in Brazil, the Butantan Institute, said yesterday it was “surprised” by the decision.
EN_303	7	The institute “is investigating in detail what happened,” and “is at the Brazilian regulatory agency’s disposal to provide any clarification necessary on any adverse incident the clinical trials may have presented,” it said.
EN_303	8	This morning Sinovac said it is “confident in the safety of the vaccine”.
EN_303	9	The company also said the adverse incident in one of its trial volunteers was “unrelated to the vaccine”.
EN_303	10	The suspension of the trial is a blow for the company and came on the same day as an announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech that their Covid-19 vaccine was 90% effective in its ongoing Phase 3 trials.
EN_303	11	European stock markets and oil prices jumped on the announcement.
EN_303	12	The announcement was cautiously welcomed by world leaders and health officials who described it as a positive step.
EN_303	13	At yesterday’s Department of Health Covid-19 briefing, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said it is “certainly night time for celebration” yet as the trial is not yet complete and regulatory authorities will still have to inspect the data when it is published.
EN_303	14	Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) said the news is “positive”, but there will still be practical challenges to work out with any vaccine.
EN_303	15	“The duration of protection, obviously is something we don’t yet know.
EN_303	16	Similarly, we know from the media reports this vaccine requires an ultra cold chain of minus 80 degrees.
EN_303	17	So, again, logistically it could be difficult to roll it out so it’s not going to be the global solution, but certainly it’s very positive first step.”
EN_303	18	Yesterday European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Commission will sign a contract with Pfizer and BioNTech for up to 300 million doses.
EN_303	19	The Commission has also reached agreements with three other companies that have a vaccine in development: It agreed with AstraZeneca to purchase 300 million doses with an option to buy 100 million more.
EN_303	20	It signed a contract to purchase up to 300 million doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine.
EN_303	21	It approved a contract with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV to purchase 200 million vaccines with the possibility to purchase a further 200 million.
EN_303	22	All of these agreements are on the basis that the vaccine has been proven to be safe and effective once it has gone through regulatory assessments.
EN_304	1	Under pressure, British PM vows “massive” coronavirus tests increase (video)
EN_304	2	Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to ramp up testing for coronavirus after his government faced criticism for being slower than some European peers to roll out mass checks for front-line health workers and the population.
EN_304	3	Britain initially took a much more restrained approach to the outbreak but changed tack after modelling showed a quarter of a million people in the country could perish.
EN_304	4	Johnson imposed more stringent measures, effectively shuttering the world’s fifth largest economy, but the government has faced widespread criticism for having far too few ventilators and doing far too few tests.
EN_304	5	“We’re also massively increasing testing,” Johnson said in a video message from a flat in Downing Street where he is self-isolating after testing positive himself.
EN_304	6	“I want to say a special word about testing because it is so important.
EN_304	7	As I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through: this is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle, this is how we will defeat it in the end.”
EN_304	8	Johnson’s message, posted on Twitter on Wednesday evening, followed pledges from his ministers to accelerate testing in the days and weeks ahead after a slew of sometimes contradictory statements on the numbers already checked.
EN_304	9	While Germany has been testing about 500,000 people a week, Britain’s current capacity is about 13,000 a day, a figure the government said it was aiming to double by mid-April.
EN_304	10	As of 0800 GMT on April 1, 152,979 people in the United Kingdom have been tested, of which 29,474 were confirmed positive.
EN_304	11	The death toll rose 31% to 2,352 as of 1600 GMT on March 31.
EN_304	12	ENABLING RETURN TO WORK.
EN_304	13	Tests are essential for both fighting the virus and nursing the economy back to health after what is expected to be the worst quarter in around a century.
EN_304	14	Testing frontline health staff allows those with immunity to return to work while broader testing of the population would allow tens of millions of idled workers back to work.
EN_304	15	So far, tests have been focused on those suspected to have the virus and admitted to hospital, but the government plans to increase testing of frontline healthcare staff to hundreds of thousands in coming weeks.
EN_304	16	“What we need to do is massively ramp up not just tests so that you can know whether you have had the disease in the past – so-called antibody tests – so that will enable you to go to work in the confidence that you can’t be infected or infectious,” Johnson said.
EN_304	17	Ministers have suggested shortages of necessary chemicals were a factor, though the industry has said the necessary reagents are being manufactured and delivered to the National Health Service.
EN_304	18	Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute, a biomedical discovery institute researching the biology underlying human health, said Britain was not ready for the outbreak and for mass testing in particular.
EN_304	19	“We weren’t sufficiently prepared, I think that’s clear but now the time is to get our shoulder behind the wheel and do as much as we can to help everybody in this country,” he told BBC radio.

EN_313	1	Russian soldier pleads guilty in first war crimes trial of Ukraine conflict
EN_313	2	A 21-year-old Russian soldier facing the first war crimes trial since Moscow invaded Ukraine has pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed civilian.
EN_313	3	Sergeant Vadim Shishimarin could get life in prison for shooting a 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through an open car window in the northeastern Sumy region on February 28, four days into the invasion.
EN_313	4	Shishimarin, a captured member of a Russian tank unit, was prosecuted under a section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war.
EN_313	5	Vadim Shishimarin behind glass during the court hearing in Kyiv (Efrem Lukatsky/AP) Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova previously said her office was readying war crimes cases against 41 Russian soldiers for offences that included bombing civilian infrastructure, killing civilians, rape and looting.
EN_313	6	It was not immediately clear how many of the suspects were in Ukrainian hands and how many would be tried in absentia.
EN_313	7	As the inaugural war crimes case in Ukraine, Shishimarin’s prosecution was being watched closely.
EN_313	8	Investigators have been collecting evidence of possible war crimes to bring before the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
EN_313	9	Ms Venediktova’s office has said it was looking into more than 10,700 potential war crimes involving more than 600 suspects, including Russian soldiers and government officials.
EN_313	10	Shishimarin talks with his translator (Efrem Lukatsky/AP) With help from foreign experts, prosecutors are investigating allegations that Russian troops violated Ukrainian and international law by killing, torturing and abusing possibly thousands of Ukrainian civilians.
EN_313	11	Shishimarin’s trial opened on Friday, when he made a brief court appearance while lawyers and judges discussed procedural matters.
EN_313	12	Ukrainian authorities posted a few details on social media last week from their investigation in his case.
EN_313	13	Shishimarin was said to be among a group of Russian troops that fled Ukrainian forces on February 28, according to Ms Venediktova’s Facebook account.
EN_313	14	The Russians allegedly fired at a private car and seized the vehicle, then drove to Chupakhivka, a village about 200 miles east of Kyiv.
EN_313	15	The courtroom in Kyiv (Efrem Lukatsky/AP) On the way, the prosecutor general alleged, the Russian soldiers saw a man walking on the pavement and talking on his phone.
EN_313	16	Shyshimarin was ordered to kill the man so he would not be able to report them to Ukrainian military authorities.
EN_313	17	Ms Venediktova did not identify who gave the order.
EN_313	18	Shyshimarin fired his Kalashnikov rifle through the open window and hit the victim in the head, Ms Venediktova wrote.
EN_313	19	“The man died on the spot just a few dozen metres from his house,” she said.
EN_313	20	The Security Service of Ukraine, known as the SBU, posted a short video on May 4 of Shyshimarin speaking in front of a camera and briefly describing how he shot the man.
EN_313	21	The SBU described the video as “one of the first confessions of the enemy invaders”.
EN_313	22	“I was ordered to shoot,” Shyshimarin said.
EN_313	23	“I shot one (round) at him.
EN_313	24	He falls.
EN_313	25	And we kept on going.”
EN_313	26	Russia is believed to be preparing war crime trials for Ukrainian soldiers.
EN_316	1	Two Russian Ammo Depots Destroyed After Key Bridge Crippled: Ukraine
EN_316	2	Ukraine has aggressively unleashed attacks in Zaporizhzhia this week.
EN_316	3	Zaporizhzhia, a Ukrainian district that Russia illegally annexed in September, is currently partially occupied by Russian forces.
EN_316	4	"One week ago, the Kremlin announced Russia wouldn't seize any more territory from Ukraine , rather focusing on a return of its original goals of the ""demilitarization and denazification"" of Ukraine while maintaining the four territories it illegally annexed in September."
EN_316	5	Zaporizhzhia is in southeastern Ukraine and is home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant.
EN_316	6	Ukraine hasn't folded its efforts in those areas and successfully liberated Kherson in November, although Russia continues to claim the district remains under Kremlin annexation.
EN_316	7	Lately, Ukrainian forces have focused their counteroffensive efforts in Zaporizhzhia.
EN_316	8	This photograph taken on December 13, 2022, shows a destroyed ammunition depot belonging to the Russian army on the outskirts of Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

EN_316	10	GETTY.
EN_316	11	On Monday, Ukraine destroyed a key bridge Russian forces used to shuttle supplies across the Molochna River.
EN_316	12	Shortly after, on Wednesday, Ukraine struck again, this time targeting two Russian ammunition depots and destroying those as well.
EN_316	13	"""The enemy continues to suffer losses,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on on Thursday."
EN_316	14	According to the post, Ukrainian forces targeted the Tokmak, Polohy and Berdyansk settlements in Zaporizhzhia.
EN_316	15	"""The Defense Forces destroyed two enemy ammunition depots, two artillery systems with ammunition, as well as six units of military equipment of various types."
EN_316	16	"More than 200 enemy servicemen were wounded,"" the post said."
EN_316	17	The post also said Ukrainian forces elicited 11 air strikes on Russian troops, targeting servicemembers, weapons and military equipment.
EN_316	18	Two strikes were unleashed on Russia's missile systems.
EN_316	19	Earlier this week, Ukraine claimed the attack on the critical bridge , which crosses the Molochna River and connects the city of Melitopol and the village of Kostyantynivka in Zaporizhzhia.
EN_316	20	Newsweek previously reported that Russian news outlet Ria Novosti said the bridge was damaged but survived the attack.
EN_316	21	Ria Novosti reported explosives were placed on the bridge's support system, and although it didn't fall, traffic was suspended.
EN_316	22	Newsweek could not independently verify the outlet's statement about the bridge's condition.
EN_316	23	Experts previously told Newsweek that the bridge damage could cut Russians off from necessary supplies, such as food, adequate uniforms and weapons.
EN_316	24	Both Russia and Ukraine have attempted to use the cold winter weather as an ally by targeting their opponent in a way that could degrade soldier morale.
EN_316	25	The attack prevents Russian soldiers from receiving necessary supplies to continue fighting during the winter months.
EN_316	26	Russia also has targeted Ukraine in similar ways, launching attacks on the nation's critical infrastructure and shuttering the nation in darkness as its key energy sources were damaged or destroyed.

EN_323	1	Taiwan to Extend Military Service Amid Rising Tensions With China
EN_323	2	Taiwan is due to extend its compulsory military service from four months to at least one year, the island's most senior defense official told lawmakers on Wednesday, in a move to better prepare the country's citizens for a hot war with neighboring China.
EN_323	3	Taiwanese military-age males could begin serving the longer regimens in 2024 if the decision is made before the end of this year, Chiu Kuo-cheng, the defense minister, told reporters outside the Legislative Yuan,
EN_323	4	's parliament.
EN_323	5	Discussions for the complex policy shift are still ongoing, he said, noting that delaying the announcement into the new year would inevitably push back implementation by a further 12 months to a 2025 start.
EN_323	6	"""The military's thinking is very straightforward,"" said Chiu."
EN_323	7	"""How do we increase our military capabilities and enhance our training?"
EN_323	8	Those are the considerations.
EN_323	9	Protecting our country is everybody's
EN_323	10	Local media reports said the Executive Yuan, which comprises President Tsai Ing-wen's cabinet, could make the announcement on December 22.
EN_323	11	It would extend military service to 12 months for conscripts born after 2006.
EN_323	12	Under Tsai's predecessor, Taipei wound down conscription to four months as part of the island's transition to an all-volunteer force of professional soldiers.
EN_323	13	Its military now fields 165,000 active-duty troops and roughly 20,000 short-term conscripts at any one time.
EN_323	14	The four-month regimen, which began in 2013, was implemented at a time of reduced tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
EN_323	15	However, Tsai and her anti-unification party have been urged to review the policy since they took power in 2016.
EN_323	16	Her government has sought to balance souring relations with China against calls by the United States to show more resolve to fight.
EN_323	17	The debate about conscription gained further momentum after Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, with Taiwan now on course to reverse the policy after less than a decade.
EN_323	18	Aside from preparing its armed forces for a conflict that has been brewing for more than 70 years, Taiwan's other challenges also include girding its population for the unthinkable by encouraging more participation in public and private
EN_323	19	Washington, whose longstanding security relationship with Taipei doesn't include a concrete defense commitment, despite President Joe Biden's comments suggesting otherwise, is also watching the island's determination to reform its reserves, which number more than two million on paper.
EN_323	20	Chiu, Taiwan's defense chief, said a pilot program that called up some 15,000 reservists for a two-week training regime this year had shown promising results and would be expanded by 7,000 personnel in 2023.
EN_323	21	It means around 22,000 reservists will undergo two weeks of more intensive combat training next year, in addition to the 97,000 reservists who are recalled annually for a weeklong training course.
EN_323	22	Those who took part in the longer test program more than doubled their marksmanship training to 28 hours and quadrupled the time spent on combat skills to 56 hours, returning better results in both areas, Taiwan's defense ministry said in a parliamentary report.
EN_323	23	Separately on Tuesday in the U.S., Congress moved a step closer to boosting Taiwan's defense capacity in significant ways after House and Senate committees submitted a compromise version of the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act to fund national defense in 2023.
EN_323	24	The NDAA, which is requesting up to $857.9 billion, includes $12 billion in grants and loans for Taiwan to be used to procure U.S. weapons and services between 2023 and 2027.

EN_332	1	Jim Jordan, One of Trump's Biggest Defenders, Gets Interview Request from Jan. 6 Panel
EN_332	2	The House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol insurrection has requested an interview with
EN_332	3	Ohio
EN_332	4	Rep. Jordan is now the second House representative to be summoned to the panel this week, with the first being Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry.
EN_332	5	Like Perry, Jordan has been a fierce defender of former President Donald Trump and has helped spread the unproven theory that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
EN_332	6	He had warned the panel that asking to speak with GOP lawmakers would result in retribution.
EN_332	7	The panel's chairman, Mississippi Rep.
EN_332	8	Bennie Thompson wrote a letter to Jordan asking to discuss his communications with Trump leading up to the January 6 riots.
EN_332	9	"""We understand that you had at least one and possibly multiple communications with President Trump on January 6th,"" the letter said."
EN_332	10	"""We would like to discuss each such communication with you in detail."""
EN_332	11	This summoning comes a week after the panel revealed a text message sent by Jordan that appeared to outline a potential plan to overturn the results of the presidential election.
EN_332	12	"The text said that former Vice President Mike Pence ""should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all."""
EN_332	13	Jordan frequently defended Trump during his time in office and has even supported Stop the Steal movements that falsely claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen by current President He appeared at a Stop the Steal rally in November 2020 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and has made several statements regarding the validity of the election's results.
EN_332	14	He, along with Kentucky Rep.
EN_332	15	James Comer, had previously called for a congressional investigation into the election.
EN_332	16	"""Given you role as leaders of a political part that spent four years baselessly calling into question the legitimacy of the 2016 election with debunked allegations of Russian collusion,"" his letter from November 2020 said."
EN_332	17	"""You owe it to all Americans to fully examine allegations of actual election errors and misconduct."""
EN_332	18	Due to this history, it is unlikely that Jordan will comply with the panel's requests.
EN_332	19	He currently has not commented on the summons.
EN_332	20	The request is the second by the nine-member panel this week and launches a new phase for the lawmakers on the committee, who have so far resisted going after one of their own as they investigate the insurrection by supporters and his efforts to overturn the election.

EN_335	2	Protesters from 'People’s Republic of Knocknagoshel' object to Eir mast at An Bord Pleanála HQ
EN_335	3	While An Bord Pleanala’s decision on the mobile communications mast has not been made yet, its recent history with this type of application is a problematic one
EN_335	4	There was an element of theatre to proceedings, between organiser Michelle Keane invoking the People’s Republic of Knocknagoshel in a brief speech outside the offices, to the gathering’s main banner, which cheerfully quoted another famous rebel, Charles Stewart Parnell: “Arise Knocknagoshel and take your place among the nations of the earth.”
EN_335	5	Ms Keane had ended the merry protest by officially delivering her objection to mobile operator Eir’s application to build a “monstrosity” mobile communications mast in her village to An Bord Pleanála's reception staff.
EN_335	6	Theatrics aside, however, there was an important point being made, and one which could spell a significant headache for An Bord Pleanála in the not-too-distant future.
EN_335	7	Knocknagoshel may be small — population circa 750 — but its residents’ actions in protesting an application to build a 15-metre high telecoms mast in the heart of their village are noteworthy.
EN_335	8	While An Bord Pleanala’s decision has not even been made yet, its recent history with this type of application is a problematic one.
EN_335	9	Bad track record.
EN_335	10	In May of 2022, this paper reported that Paul Hyde, the former chair of the planning body had been approving mast appeals, notably by Eir, over the previous 20 months.
EN_335	11	Of the 102 such applications we looked at, Mr Hyde had been involved in 77 of them, beating the law of averages by a distance (applications are supposed to be randomly dispersed among board members).
EN_335	12	He approved 72 of them, and overruled his own inspectors’ recommendations of refusal at a rate 9 times greater than the board's average.
EN_335	13	For applications by Eir, the figures were even more striking.
EN_335	14	Mr Hyde, who resigned from the board last July and is facing a criminal investigation, was involved in 42 such appeals during the period in question.
EN_335	15	He approved all 42.
EN_335	16	Of those, 35, or 83% of them, had initially been refused at local authority level.
EN_335	17	Those eye-catching statistics recently formed the basis for the judicial review of a mast decision made in 2021 for another rural village, Kells in Co Kilkenny.
EN_335	18	Despite the appeal being well outside the statute of limitations of 8 weeks for such an action, leave was granted for the case to proceed.
EN_335	19	The Irish Examiner understands that numerous similar actions are in gestation.
EN_335	20	Should they succeed en masse, and there is a distinct possibility the masts in question will have to go, and An Bord Pleanála will have to foot the legal bill.
EN_335	21	This brings us back to Knocknagoshel.
EN_335	22	Ms Keane and her co-protestors have put it up toA n Bord Pleanála's new interim chair Oonagh Buckley and asked her to take note of the fact Eir’s application for the village had already been refused by Kerry County Council three times.
EN_335	23	Organiser Michelle Keane with her daughter Holly Darcy from 'The Peoples Republic of Knocknagoshel' outside An Bord Pleanála HQ in Dublin.
EN_335	24	Picture: Tony Gavin.
EN_335	25	“It’s not as if we don’t want the mast at all,” local Donal Falvey, whose property borders the planned site of the monopole at the old Eircom exchange in the village, said.
EN_335	26	“We couldn’t have been more accommodating.
EN_335	27	We just don’t want it in the centre of the community.
EN_335	28	We don’t want it beside the school.”
EN_335	29	In its refusal, last January, Kerry Co Council said the mast would contravene the telecommunication policies set out in its most recent county development plan.
EN_335	30	An Bord Pleanála has lost countless strategic development cases in court for dismissing those development plans.
EN_335	31	Should the authority decide to ignore the decision by the local authority and grant permission anyway, you suspect it may have another legal case on its hands.
EN_335	32	And others who have come out on the wrong end of these mast decisions are likely to be watching.
EN_338	1	Young Fine Gael branch criticises president for attending US right-wing conference
EN_338	2	THE ATTENDANCE OF two Young Fine Gael (YFG) committee members at a US right-wing conference has been criticised by the DCU branch of the youth group.
EN_338	3	The Dublin City University (DCU) wing of Young Fine Gael said it feels “concern and disappointment” over the president attending the conference.
EN_338	4	“Members of the executive council, especially the president, chose to take up the mantle of responsibility for the entirety of their term which they were elected to serve,” a statement from DCU YFG said.
EN_338	5	“To state a highly political trip, publicised on social media, was in an entirely personal capacity during the term of president is not an acceptable defence.”
EN_338	6	YFG president Killian Foley-Walsh and social media officer Chloe Kennedy attended the National Conservative Student Conference in the US last week.
EN_338	7	This is a right-wing convention held by Young America’s Foundation, a youth conservative group with pro-life views.
EN_338	8	US Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the five-day conference.
EN_338	9	Other speakers included US senator Ted Cruz and pro-life activist Lila Rose.
EN_338	10	Both of the YFG members who went to the event told the Irish Independent that they attended in a personal capacity and that the trip was funded by themselves and the Edmund Burke Institute, a conservative educational charity.
EN_338	11	Young Fine Gael is the youth wing of the Fine Gael party for people aged 15 to 35.
EN_338	12	It is an autonomous organisation that embodies the values of the political party.
EN_338	13	Fine Gael declined to comment on the incident.
EN_338	14	Representing views.
EN_338	15	Ógra Fianna Fáil president Ian Woods told TheJournal.ie that YFG members should be free to attend such events if they align with the views of their leadership.
EN_338	16	“It is up to Young Fine Gael members to decide whether the attendance of their president at events such as this is representative of their views,” said Woods.
EN_338	17	“My belief is that YFG members’ enthusiastic cheerleading of this particular foreign political party is reflective of the views of a large section of YFG and Fine Gael’s membership.”
EN_338	18	Members of an organisation called Free Speech Ireland also attended the event last week.
EN_338	19	A statement from two group members said they were disappointed by the “unfair attacks” on those who attended the conference.
EN_338	20	“We attended the conference to enhance our knowledge of political values and to hear from a broad range of conservative and classical liberal speakers,” the statement said.
EN_338	21	The attendance was also criticised by some FG party members.
EN_338	22	Fine Gael TD Noel Rock who is also a member of YFG said this attendance didn’t represent the “progressive” YFG members he knows.
EN_338	23	Fine Gael MEP for the Midlands North-West Maria Walsh told the Irish Independent that she will be writing to the YFG committee calling for Foley-Walsh to resign as president.
EN_346	1	Long-serving diplomat: State security clearance denial unjustified
EN_346	2	in relation to suspicions concern embezzlement by an official, while suspicions relating to mishandling of classified foreign information have been downgraded to a misdemeanor.
EN_346	3	"""Since I began working for the Estonian foreign service thirty years ago, my security clearance has been renewed at least eight times through the spring of 2021."
EN_346	4	"I have devoted my entire 30-years of foreign service to the benefit of the Republic of Estonia and I can assure you that I have not provided any substantive or formal cause for the refusal of my state secrets clearance renewal,"" wrote Kull on Tuesday, before the beginning of the hearing, in his media address."
EN_346	5	Kull stated that a security clearance is necessary for diplomatic duties.
EN_346	6	"""Following the decision of the Estonian Internal Security Service not to renew my state secrets clearance on May 18 2021, I was recalled by presidential order on May 20 from my position as ambassador to France and the OECD."
EN_346	7	"I am confident that a fundamental misunderstanding has occurred, and I seek to defend my legal rights,"" Kull wrote."
EN_346	8	Kull's lawyers filed the complaint with the administrative court against the police's refusal to prolong Kull's state secrets clearance on June 17 2021, but it was dismissed on December 17.
EN_346	9	"""The court decided that since I no longer hold a post needing access to state secrets, there is no grounds for evaluating the appeal,"" Kull explained."
EN_346	10	Kull's lawers, Aivar and Marko Pilv, filed an appeal to the second-tier Tallinn District Court, where it was upheld, and the case has been referred back to the Tallinn Administrative Court for substantive review.
EN_346	11	The court will rule on Kull's appeal on July 15.
EN_346	12	Separately, the prosecutor's office has been investigating Kull on suspicions of embezzlement (pertaining to representational costs) and the alleged mishandling of state classified information.
EN_346	13	The prosecutor's office has not yet completed the preliminary investigation into the first suspicion, i.e. of embezzlement, which in May 2021 Public Prosecutor Inna Ombler said concerned thousands of euros and not more.
EN_346	14	The earlier suspicion regarding classified information handling has since been reduced to a misdemeanor,
EN_346	15	Kull, 63, has previously said that the public prosecutor's office and the ISS have ruined his career.
EN_346	16	Aivar Pil stated last May that the activities under scrutiny stretched back 20-25 years and that this needs to be borne in mind when establishing the facts.
EN_346	17	Kull remained a Ministry of Foreign Affairs employee after having been recalled as ambassador to France in May last year, a post he took on in December 2019, when the ISS investigation was first opened.
EN_346	18	Kull is a former ambassador to Germany, Belgium, a former representative to the EU, and a former representative to NATO and to the UN.
EN_346	19	In October 2020 in his dual role as Estonia's Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) representative he presented then-President Kersti Kaljulaid's candidacy as secretary general of that organization.
EN_346	20	He was awarded the Order of the National Coat of Arms (Riigivapi teenetemärk) Class V in 2001 and Class III in 2018.
EN_346	21	The foreign ministry has, going on its public stance, backed him since the ISS investigation became public last May, and it was the latest effort to renew his security clearance starting from May 2021 after the previous clearance expired which has led to the current case Kull is pursuing.

EN_353	1	Former BBC director-general: Reinstatement is ‘like a 5-0 win’ for Gary Lineker
EN_353	2	A former BBC director-general has said the reinstatement of Gary Lineker as host of Match Of The Day is like “a 5-0 win” for the sports presenter.
EN_353	3	G reg Dyke, who is also a former chair of the Football Association (FA), said there was a perception that the broadcaster had been “bullied” by the Government into its initial decision to remove Linker from the programme.
EN_353	4	On Monday, current BBC director-general Tim Davie apologised for “the potential confusion caused by the grey areas of the BBC’s social media guidance” that had resulted in the recent impartiality row.
EN_353	5	Lineker, 62, was taken off air for a tweet comparing the language used to launch a new Government asylum seeker policy to that of 1930s Germany, resulting in a boycott of MOTD by several regular pundits and commentators.
EN_353	6	Confirming his return to the football highlights show on Saturday, Mr Davie said the presenter “will abide by the editorial guidelines” until a review of the BBC’s social media policy is complete.
EN_353	7	Speaking on Tonight with Andrew Marr, Mr Dyke said: “Today’s announcement is like a 5-0 win for Gary Lineker really, or maybe 5-1.
EN_353	8	“As I understand it, this was the very solution that was offered to the BBC on Friday, and they turned it down – now they’ve accepted it.”
EN_353	9	Mr Dyke was director-general of the BBC from 2000 to 2004, but resigned following heavy criticism of the BBC’s news reporting process in the Hutton Inquiry.
EN_353	10	He also held the post of FA chairman from 2013 to 2016.
EN_353	11	He told Marr: “In the 20 years since I left the BBC, I’ve never criticised the leadership of the BBC because I think it’s a tough job, as you know, really.
EN_353	12	“And I think by and large, if you’re an ex-director, generally your job is to walk away.
EN_353	13	“But in this case, I think the perception out there, the perception amongst the public is, is exactly what you said: that it looks like the Government has bullied the BBC into taking this (original) decision.
EN_353	14	“Now, I don’t know whether that’s true or not.
EN_353	15	I have no idea.
EN_353	16	But if that’s the perception, it’s very bad news for the BBC.”
EN_353	17	The impartiality row over Lineker’s tweet has also raised further questions about the position of BBC chairman Richard Sharp, after it emerged he had helped former prime minister Boris Johnson secure an £800,000 loan facility.
EN_353	18	An investigation is currently under way into Mr Sharp’s appointment to the position.
EN_353	19	Asked about Mr Sharp’s removal from the position, Mr Dyke said: “I’m not sure I do think he should go.
EN_353	20	“I personally hope there’s an opportunity in this inquiry to look at the whole way that the chairman and the governors get appointed at the BBC.
EN_353	21	“Because I think…we’re now in a world where they shouldn’t be appointed by the Government of the day.”
EN_363	1	Comment on Facebook policy chief says 'we all have a role to play' tackling online harassment following Caroline Flack death
EN_363	2	“Is this the sort of thing we discuss internally?
EN_363	3	Absolutely.
EN_363	4	All the time.
EN_363	5	We have a group of external safety groups that we work with and this includes dealing with issues like harassment and also separately we have partners that help us with suicide and self-harm prevention.”
EN_363	6	“I think we will continue to build our knowledge base, especially as these issues continue to evolve.
EN_363	7	There are always new trends and new patterns.
EN_363	8	We will continue to build that knowledge base by having the relationships that we have,” she added.
EN_363	9	Bickert was speaking following a talk she gave at the Institute of International and European Affairs.
EN_363	10	Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg held meetings with senior EU officials over the past number of days and called on governments to establish better regulations around online content.
EN_363	11	Monika Bickert made the comments following a speech at the IIEA about online content regulation.
EN_363	12	Asked how offensive and negative comments that appear under images and media articles posted on Facebook are identified or removed, Bickert said it was a “challenge” and one of the “most manual” processes.
EN_363	13	Facebook uses artificial intelligence and machine -earning technology to automatically remove fake accounts and harmful content but removing negative comments and remarks directed at specific individuals is a more difficult task.
EN_363	14	It often relies on negative comments to be flagged by users before it is investigated and removed.
EN_363	15	It also depends on how words are used, as different phrases have different meanings from country to country, making it more difficult to police.
EN_363	16	“Bullying and harassment, you will see, is one of the areas that is the most manual for us meaning our proactive ability to detect it using tools, and [then] remove it, is an area of constant challenge because it is so contextual,” Bickert said.
EN_363	17	“On bullying and harassment, every six months we put out community standards and enforcement reports where we walk through for each category of content how prevalent is it, how much content we’ve removed in this area and how much is removed before people report it to us.
EN_363	18	“It is a multi-layered approach.
EN_363	19	First we try to give people tools so they can moderate or control their own experience.
EN_363	20	Secondly, we provide a mechanism for removing specific instances of content that violate [the rules].
EN_363	21	But third, we look for overall behaviours.”
EN_363	22	On Sunday, in the wake of the Love Island presenter’s death, outgoing government minister Regina Doherty spoke of the abuse she has received online as a public figure during her career as a Fine Gael TD.
EN_363	23	“Last night, [with] that gorgeous young lady dying, we all need to take a reality check as to how we deal with people… we need to look at the way we treat each other, the way we speak to each other,” she said on the Sunday With Miriam show on RTÉ Radio 1.
EN_363	24	“If I had a euro for every time I was called the c-word in the last month, I wouldn’t need to retire,” she added.
EN_363	25	Former Fianna Fáil TD, Lisa Chambers, also spoke of the abuse she has experienced online saying all politicians get abuse but women are specifically targeted in a different way.
EN_363	26	“It’s a lot more based on the tone of your voice, the colour of your hair, how you dress.
EN_363	27	I’m pregnant currently so that was coming up a bit as well… there’s an extra level, I think.
EN_363	28	You have to be so careful about how you come across.”
EN_363	29	Tributes have flooded in for Flack over recent days with many criticising how she was treated online and in the media.
EN_363	30	A petition started by Flack’s friend and actress Stephanie Davis, which calls for greater protections for those in the public eye, has garnered more than 500,000 signature online.
EN_370	1	Army-Navy Game 2019: Record, Roster and the History of the Game
EN_370	2	The Army Black Knights and Navy Midshipmen will face off for the 120th time on Saturday and an Army victory would allow West Point seniors to graduate knowing they never lost to their long-time rivals.
EN_370	3	Saturday's game is set to be played at 2 p.m.
EN_370	4	ET at Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles, marking the 87th time Philadelphia will host the game.
EN_370	5	With West Point located in New York and the Naval Academy in Maryland, the City of Brotherly Love is about equal distance from both schools, serving as an accessible, neutral location for both teams.
EN_370	6	The rivalry is one of the longest in college football history and is one that at least 10 U.S. presidents have attended.
EN_370	7	President Donald Trump's first experience at the game was in 2016, about a month before his inauguration.
EN_370	8	Trump flipped the coin before the 2018 matchup and he's scheduled to attend this year's game, as well, according to White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.
EN_370	9	In 2016, the Black Knights broke Navy's 14-year winning streak and the victory was the catalyst to a three-year streak of Army's own.
EN_370	10	Record.
EN_370	11	Army and Navy have faced off on the gridiron a total of 119 times since the first games in 1890, according t o the Army, not including Saturday's game.
EN_370	12	Yes, those who just did the math are correct, an annual matchup beginning in 1890 would require 129 games to be played.
EN_370	13	However, there were 10 times that the Army-Navy game did not take place.
EN_370	14	After the 1893 game, an Army general and Navy admiral got into a heated argument that almost ended in a duel, prompting a competition hiatus from 1894 to 1898, according to
EN_370	15	Darnell Woolfolk of the Army Black Knights carries the ball as Taylor Heflin of the Navy Midshipmen defends at Lincoln Financial Field on December 8, 2018 in Philadelphia.
EN_370	16	Over the years, the Navy has won more games against Army, but Army is on a three-year winning streak going into Saturday's game.
EN_370	17	Elsa/Getty.
EN_370	18	Along with that interruption in game play, the matchup didn't occur in 1909 after Cadet Eugene Byrne died from an injury he received during a previous game.
EN_370	19	In 1917 and 1918 the War Department ordered the games to be canceled because of World War I.
EN_370	20	Then, in 1928 and 1929, the two institutions failed to reconcile player eligibility standards, thereby canceling the game.
EN_370	21	Navy has more victories in the series, winning 60 of the games played compared to Army's 52 wins.
EN_370	22	Army may have fewer victories under its belt, but the school's been on a bit of a winning streak, being victorious in the last three matchups.
EN_370	23	However, Army doesn't have a winning record this season at 5-7.
EN_370	24	Navy, on the other hand, sits at 9-2 for the 2019 season.
EN_370	25	"""We've just got to find a way to get one more stop, or score on one more drive, complete a drive, and you change the game,"" Army head coach Jeff Monken told the ""You change the course of the season."
EN_370	26	"So, it's been hard on our team, because we came into the season with very high expectations."""
EN_370	27	Roster.
EN_370	28	Lots of college football players dream of playing in the NFL after graduation and the NCAA reported Elijah Riley, who plays defensive back for West Point, could go pro.
EN_370	29	Riley, according to the NCAA, leads the Black Knights in tackles-for-losses and in sacks this season.
EN_370	30	On the Navy side, fans should keep an eye on quarterback Malcolm Perry.
EN_370	31	On December 4, the American Athletic Conference named the senior as offensive player of the year.
EN_370	32	In 2019, Perry had one of the best years of any Navy quarterback in school history ; he needs 88 rushing yards to surpass Napoleon McCallum's record.
EN_370	33	"""We came into a program that was on a 14-game winning streak,"" Perry told the Inquirer , referencing the Navy's previous winning streak against Army."
EN_370	34	"""Being the first group to lose that game, that builds up a lot inside of you."
EN_370	35	And losing the next two years, that builds up inside of you naturally as a competitor.
EN_370	36	"Beating our rival, just being the last game, I think urgency might fit there, but more so it's just a burning desire."""

EN_372	1	Style queen: Meet the 80-year-old star of RTE’s latest fashion series
EN_372	2	Instagram sensation Eileen Smith, 80, stars in RTÉ’s new fashion series.
EN_372	3	She talks to Rowena Walsh about helping people find their style mojo.
EN_372	4	Every night, before she goes to bed, Eileen Smith lays out her clothes for the next day.
EN_372	5	She even knows what shoes she is going to wear.
EN_372	6	Such attention to detail won’t come as a surprise to Eileen’s legions of fans, who adore her style.
EN_372	7	She is known on Instagram as EileenStyleQueen and her 56,000-plus followers include Roz Purcell and Pippa O’Connor.
EN_372	8	What really makes Eileen stand out in the world of social media is that she is just a few weeks away from celebrating her 81st birthday.
EN_372	9	And she shows no sign of slowing down.
EN_372	10	The octogenarian has teamed up with Suzanne Jackson, another social media sensation who knows her way around a wardrobe, in a new RTÉ show, The Style Counsellors, which aims to help people find their fashion mojo.
EN_372	11	Eileen, who spent her first pay packet on a pleated accordion shirt and white embroidered blouse back in the 1950s, says she’s still a blouse person.
EN_372	12	She loves a good fitted coat too and is passionate about the power of accessories to lift an outfit.
EN_372	13	Her Instagram account is filled with pictures of her demonstrating her classic pared-back style, whether she is out and about with friends, playing bridge or golf, gardening, or baking for her family.
EN_372	14	She and her daughters used to share pictures of their outfits and eventually one suggested she set up an Instagram account.
EN_372	15	Daughter Suzanne gave her the name EileenStyleQueen, which still causes Eileen a degree of embarrassment.
EN_372	16	“I don’t consider myself a style queen,” she says, “but I do love style.”
EN_372	17	She is a firm believer in buying good-quality clothes but not too many of them, happily mixing and matching items that may have been in her wardrobe for over 20 years.
EN_372	18	Her attitude — the antithesis of fast fashion — may account for her appeal among women aged 17 to 26, who make up her average demographic.
EN_372	19	“If I’m out and about in Dundrum Town Centre or somewhere like that, the people who come up and talk to me are all young ladies.”
EN_372	20	She is stunned by her newfound TV stardom.
EN_372	21	Eileen’s Instagram feed gives a peek into what she describes as a very normal life, but certainly an authentic one, and one that is lived in the best possible fashion.
EN_372	22	“I know my own style,” says the mother of four.
EN_372	23	“I know what I can’t wear, which is more important than what you can wear.”
EN_372	24	To that end, she stays away from black, which she says makes her look like a mafia widow.
EN_372	25	While she thinks that younger people can follow fashion slavishly, she says, “At my age, you have to dress your age.
EN_372	26	You have to find a style that suits you and stick to it.”
EN_372	27	She has been married to Larry for 59 years; they lived in Dubai for 12 years where Larry’s job as a pilot for Emirates meant they went out to a lot of functions.
EN_372	28	Eileen says that was her reason for going shopping and that it was fantastic there.

EN_377	1	Rally Estonia reaction: Tough, but fun, say Tänak and Märtin
EN_377	2	"""All round it was a very positive weekend,"" Tänak said of his home rally, which started in earnest with Friday afternoon's qualifying, led by Tänak and co-driver Martin Järveoja in the Toyota Yaris."
EN_377	3	He never really looked back through to the climax Sunday, by which time he had an over one-minute lead over second-placed man, Norwegian Andreas Mikkelsen (Hyundai).
EN_377	4	"""Since ( former rally driver-ed .)"
EN_377	5	Urmo Aavo put together such a great event with great emotions, we naturally had to give our all.
EN_377	6	There was a lot of background work needed to prepare for ( the next WRC rally-ed .)
EN_377	7	"Finland, this competition was also vital, and of course we wanted to coast to victory,"" the 31-year-old native of Saaremaa, who leads the WRC drivers table at present, added."
EN_377	8	"""The roads are very cool in themselves."
EN_377	9	The jumps were sometimes very devilish and maybe a bit overwhelming, but I believe that nature will do its work in the years to come, smooth things out a little, making them a little more natural.
EN_377	10	"In the bigger picture I believe that the routes are tricky, so this is a cool way to drive for a win,"" he continued."
EN_377	11	Rally Estonia took place across a swathe of land between Tartu and Otepää, in South Estonia, and included sections on the streets of Estonia's second city.
EN_377	12	The jumps Tänak spoke of took fellow Estonian driver Georg Gross out of action on Saturday, with Markko Märtin lambasting them, though full of praise for the overall event.
EN_377	13	On the likelihood of Rally Estonia becoming a full WRC event, planned for 2022, Tänak was more cautious.
EN_377	14	"""I think that there was no problem with today's organization, and getting into the WRC event up and running, but at the same time it's not quite for the people in the same way."
EN_377	15	The WRC series is perhaps bogged down in a few things and I believe that getting to the series is very complex.
EN_377	16	"The event we have as it is today is already a very good thing for Estonia,"" he continued."
EN_377	17	Markko Märtin finished sixth overall in his Ford Fiesta, with co-driver Kristo Kraag, and noted that even with his experience, such a high level event was no cakewalk.

EN_377	23	he continued.
EN_377	24	As to what was so hard about the race, Märtin responded it was simply the driving.
EN_377	25	"""If you haven't done it for such a long time as I hadn't, it's not such an easy task."
EN_377	26	"Going from every day life back to a rally car and on such quick and technically complex roads - I knew it was going to be tough, but it was even harder than I expected,"" he said."
EN_377	27	"""There were loads of fans too, Ott fans, and just Estonian rally fans."
EN_377	28	We saw the numbers of people at the roadside, and there really were a lot this year.

EN_390	1	NSPCC warns Facebook of becoming ‘one-stop grooming shop’ over encryption plans
EN_390	2	The NSPCC in the UK has warned Facebook that it risks becoming a “one-stop grooming shop” if it presses ahead with plans to encrypt across all its messaging services.
EN_390	3	Facebook is considering end-to-end encryption on Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct on top of WhatsApp, which is already encrypted but there has been deep concern that the move could prevent child abusers being caught.
EN_390	4	Out of 9,259 instances where police in England and Wales said they know the platform used in child abuse image and online child sexual offences, just over 4,000 were carried out on Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp.
EN_390	5	The data obtained by the charity from freedom of information requests to police forces between April 2018 and 2019 shows that 22% were reported on Instagram, followed by 19% on Facebook or Facebook Messenger.
EN_390	6	Only 3% (299 instances) were from WhatsApp, which the NSPCC says highlights how difficult it becomes to detect crimes on an end-to-end encrypted platform.
EN_390	7	The charity believes criminals will be able to carry out more serious child abuse on Facebook’s apps undetected without needing to lure them off to encrypted platforms, if it goes ahead with changes.
EN_390	8	“Instead of working to protect children and make the online world they live in safer, Facebook is actively choosing to give offenders a place to hide in the shadows and risks making itself a one-stop grooming shop,” said Andy Burrows, NSPCC’s head of child safety online policy.
EN_390	9	Charity wants no end-to-end encryption for messages going to or coming from children’s accounts
EN_390	10	(Peter Byrne/PA)
EN_390	11	“If Facebook fails to guarantee encryption won’t be detrimental to children’s safety, the next Government must make clear they will face tough consequences from day one for breaching their duty of care.”
EN_390	12	The NSPCC fears the true scale could be much higher, as only 32 of the 43 police forces approached provided information.
EN_390	13	It is calling for supporters to sign an open letter to Facebook, proposing measures such as no end-to-end encryption for messages going to or coming from children’s accounts.
EN_390	14	The charity also wants adults’ accounts not to be encrypted until and unless Facebook has solutions to ensure child abuse can be detected and that children’s safety will not be compromised.
EN_390	15	Heightened concerns come after the Home Secretary Priti Patel and her counterparts in the US and Australia wrote to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, explaining how such a move could hinder law enforcement trying to investigate child abusers and terrorists operating online.
EN_390	16	A Facebook spokesman responded, saying: “There is no place for grooming or child exploitation on our platforms.
EN_390	17	“We use technology to proactively remove it and are developing further ways to detect patterns of harmful behaviour in order to ban and report those responsible.
EN_390	18	“We work closely with child protection authorities in the UK, and we’re consulting with experts on the best ways to implement safety measures before fully implementing end-to-end encryption.”
EN_390	19	Snapchat, Kik, Facetime, Twitter, Skype, YouTube and Tumblr were among some of the other platforms that police reported were used in the offences, though the NSPCC points out that Facebook’s scale means their encryption plans will pose a huge risk to young people.
EN_390	20	Rob Jones, director of threat leadership at the National Crime Agency (NCA), said: “Facebook’s current end-to-end encryption proposals could place key information about what their users say and do out of the reach of law enforcement investigations.”
EN_M_003	1	Talent is evenly spread in this country, but opportunity is not.
EN_M_003	2	As Conservatives, we believe absolutely in equality of opportunity – the idea that every child, in every part of the country, should have a fair chance.
EN_M_003	3	It is not only the most important thing we can do to unleash the UK’s potential, but is at the heart of creating a fair and just society.
EN_M_003	4	This is why we want to ensure every child has access to a great state school – that every pupil gets the qualifications they need for a prosperous future, while learning in an environment where they will be happy and fulfilled.
EN_M_003	5	One of the Conservative Party’s proudest achievements is that we have raised standards in our schools and improved behaviour.
EN_M_003	6	Students learn best when they are stretched, challenged and nurtured – in an environment where there is no disruption and no excuses for bad behaviour.
EN_M_003	7	In the last nine years, the percentage of children passing their primary reading check has gone up from 58 per cent to 82 per cent.
EN_M_003	8	We have strengthened teachers’ powers to deal with bullying and disruption.
EN_M_003	9	We have given schools the ability to decide how money is best spent – because we trust parents and headteachers to know what is best for the children in their care.
EN_M_003	10	For our children to get the training and opportunities they deserve, they need to have the best teachers.
EN_M_003	11	We want to attract the best talent into teaching and recognise the great work they do, so we’re raising teachers’ starting salaries to £30,000 – among the most competitive in the graduate labour market.
EN_M_003	12	We also want to build on our record of raising standards, improving behaviour and promoting knowledge and creativity.
EN_M_003	13	We will back heads and teachers on discipline.
EN_M_003	14	We will expand our programme to help schools with the worst behaviour learn from the best – and back heads to use exclusions.
EN_M_003	15	Unlike Labour, we believe that Ofsted inspection serves a valuable purpose not just in improving standards but in improving behaviour.
EN_M_003	16	We will continue to help teachers tackle bullying, including homophobic bullying.
EN_M_003	17	No child should be bullied on account of who their parents are or where they come from.
EN_M_003	18	We will create more great schools.
EN_M_003	19	We will continue to do everything we can to ensure every school is a great school.
EN_M_003	20	We will continue to support innovation, like our successful maths schools, set up for the most gifted young physicists and mathematicians.
EN_M_003	21	We will expand ‘alternative provision’ schools for those who have been excluded.
EN_M_003	22	We will also deliver more school places for children with complex Special Educational Needs.
EN_M_003	23	We will intervene in schools where there is entrenched underperformance.
EN_M_003	24	We will continue to ensure that parents can choose the schools that best suit their children and best prepare them for the future.
EN_M_003	25	And we will continue to build more free schools.
EN_M_003	26	We will invest in arts, music and sport.
EN_M_003	27	Over the last nine years we have made real improvements in maths, English and science, and given more children access to a rich academic curriculum.
EN_M_003	28	We retain our commitment to the core subjects and also want young people to learn creative skills and widen their horizons, so we will offer an ‘arts premium’ to secondary schools to fund enriching activities for all pupils.
EN_M_003	29	And to ensure children are getting an active start to life, we will invest in primary school PE teaching and ensure that it is being properly delivered.
EN_M_003	30	We want to do more to help schools make good use of their sports facilities and to promote physical literacy and competitive sport.
EN_M_006	1	Conservation is, and always has been, at the heart of Conservatism.
EN_M_006	2	Our Government’s stewardship of the natural environment, its focus on protecting the countryside and reducing plastic waste, is a source of immense pride.
EN_M_006	3	But today, the climate emergency means that the challenges we face stretch far beyond our borders.
EN_M_006	4	Thanks to the efforts of successive Governments, the UK has cut carbon emissions by more than any similar developed country.
EN_M_006	5	We are now the world’s leader in offshore wind – a fantastic success story of Government and the private sector working hand in hand to cut costs and deliver ever more electricity at plummeting costs.
EN_M_006	6	Unlike Jeremy Corbyn, we believe that free markets, innovation and prosperity can protect the planet.Yet we recognise that there is far more that needs to be done.
EN_M_006	7	We will lead the global fight against climate change by delivering on our world-leading target of Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as advised by the independent Committee on Climate Change.
EN_M_006	8	We have doubled International Climate Finance.
EN_M_006	9	And we will use our position hosting the UN Climate Change Summit in Glasgow in 2020 to ask our global partners to match our ambition.
EN_M_006	10	We will set up new international partnerships to tackle deforestation and protect vital landscapes and wildlife corridors.
EN_M_006	11	We will establish a new £500 million Blue Planet Fund to help protect our oceans from plastic pollution, warming sea temperatures and overfishing, and extend the Blue Belt programme to preserve the maritime environment.
EN_M_006	12	We will continue to lead diplomatic efforts to protect 30 per cent of the world’s oceans by 2030.
EN_M_006	13	Our first Budget will prioritise the environment: investing in R&D; decarbonisation schemes; new flood defences, which will receive £4 billion in new funding over the coming years; electric vehicle infrastructure including a national plug-in network and gigafactory; and clean energy.
EN_M_006	14	In the next decade, we will work with the market to deliver two million new high quality jobs in clean growth.
EN_M_006	15	We have ambitious targets: Our world-leading offshore wind industry will reach 40GW by 2030, and we will enable new floating wind farms.
EN_M_006	16	We will invest £800 million to build the first fully deployed carbon capture storage cluster by the mid-2020s.
EN_M_006	17	We will invest £500 million to help energy-intensive industries move to low-carbon techniques.
EN_M_006	18	We will support gas for hydrogen production and nuclear energy, including fusion, as important parts of the energy system, alongside increasing our commitment to renewables.
EN_M_006	19	We placed a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect.
EN_M_006	20	Having listened to local communities, we have ruled out changes to the planning system.
EN_M_006	21	We will not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.
EN_M_006	22	We will support clean transport to ensure clean air, as well as setting strict new laws on air quality.
EN_M_006	23	We will consult on the earliest date by which we can phase out the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars.
EN_M_007	1	The DUP does not believe that the current defence arrangements for the United Kingdom are adequate enough to cope with either the existing or the emerging threats of the 21st Century.
EN_M_007	2	It is clear from the decision-making of the Ministry of Defence that they do not have confidence in its own Defence and National Security Reviews.
EN_M_007	3	The British military industrial complex is no longer in a position to reconstitute large numbers of manpower or materiel to meet the needs of a national crisis.
EN_M_007	4	Therefore, Defence needs to embark on a medium-term strategy of enhanced investment to restore the size of our Armed Forces to a position that more accurately reflects the threats we face and the strategic ambition to retain P5 status at the UN and play a leading role in NATO.
EN_M_007	5	We must always retain the capacity to operate independently in the national interest when required whilst ensuring that we offer credible support to our key strategic ally, the US, and other partners.
EN_M_007	6	Conflicts in the Middle East, instability in Eastern Europe, international terrorism and the proliferation of cyber-attacks illustrate the multiplicity of threats, both conventional and unconventional, and not just from states but also trans-national groups of linked terror movements.
EN_M_007	7	This is further exacerbated by the displacements of large numbers of refugees within which small numbers of those with malevolent intent seek to hide.
EN_M_007	8	This places additional burdens on the defence, security and intelligence apparatus of the country.
EN_M_007	9	There is an ever-greater need to strengthen the ability of our forces to deploy rapidly and to adapt to new threats.
EN_M_007	10	The dissident Republican terrorist threat is a major concern to all our citizens in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
EN_M_007	11	The intelligence community and our security forces must be given a budget and rules of engagement that enable them not only to gather the intelligence required to deter the threat from Republican splinter groups but also to actively pursue such terrorists and defeat them.
EN_M_007	12	Ninety percent of those who died during the Troubles were killed by paramilitaries yet the balance of investigations is disproportionately against former police officers and soldiers.
EN_M_007	13	A one- sided approach only serves those who want to re-write the past and glorify terrorism.
EN_M_007	14	It is only natural that the public are outraged to see former soldiers who stood against the brutal terrorism of the seventies and eighties instigated by the IRA, now being hounded while those who hid behind balaclavas to avoid justice are given ‘hero’ status and places on Policing Boards.
EN_M_007	15	Our troubled past can only be dealt with effectively in an honest and holistic manner, not the partial way republicans would wish.
EN_M_007	16	Government needs to ensure terrorists are pursued, with full police powers to conduct effective and comprehensive investigations and arrest suspects.
EN_M_007	17	We will do everything we can to assist innocent victims to obtain a measure of justice.
EN_M_011	1	Out of many, we are one.
EN_M_011	2	That bedrock American idea has animated our country from its earliest days, inspiring people from every corner of the earth to participate in our great democratic experiment.
EN_M_011	3	The Trump Administration has repudiated that idea and abandoned our values as a diverse, compassionate, and welcoming country.
EN_M_011	4	Instead of pursuing a sensible, humane, and responsible approach to immigration that strengthens the United States, the Trump Administration has been callous, cruel, and reckless in the extreme.
EN_M_011	5	President Trump’s immigration policies have made our communities less safe, undermined our economy, and tarnished our image around the world.
EN_M_011	6	This Administration’s cruelty and dehumanization of immigrants stretches the imagination and shocks the conscience: forcibly separating families and putting children in cages; deporting veterans who have fought to defend our freedoms; conducting militarized raids on our workplaces; endangering lives by denying COVID-19 testing and treatment based on immigration status, including to essential workers at the forefront of the pandemic response; banning people from traveling to the United States based on their faith or their country of origin; and turning away refugees and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution.
EN_M_011	7	These actions should not happen in our country again.
EN_M_011	8	Immigrants are essential to our society and our economy.
EN_M_011	9	Immigrants are part of our families.
EN_M_011	10	They enrich our culture.
EN_M_011	11	They grow our food, care for our loved ones, serve in our armed forces, and provide critical health care services.
EN_M_011	12	Immigrants make America stronger.
EN_M_011	13	Not only do immigrants support us—immigrants are us.
EN_M_011	14	Our families and our communities, our congregations and our schools, our businesses large and small have been built and sustained through the inclusion of immigrants.
EN_M_011	15	That’s why Democrats commit to building a 21st century immigration system that reflects our values, repairs past harms, heals our communities, rebuilds our economy, and renews our global leadership
EN_M_011	16	Democrats believe the United States should be a beacon of hope for those who are suffering violence and injustice, which is why we will protect and expand the existing asylum system and other humanitarian protections.
EN_M_011	17	We will reverse Trump Administration policies that prevent victims of gang and domestic violence, as well as LGBTQ+ people who are unsafe in their home countries, from being eligible to apply for asylum.
EN_M_011	18	Democrats will end Trump Administration policies that deny protected entry to asylum seekers, put them at great risk, and destabilize our neighbors and the broader region.
EN_M_011	19	And we will end prosecution of asylum seekers at the border and policies that force them to apply from “safe third countries,” which are far from safe.
EN_M_011	20	Democrats believe that our fight to end systemic and structural racism in our country extends to our immigration system, including the policies at our borders and ports of entry, detention centers, and within immigration law enforcement agencies and their policies and operations.
EN_M_011	21	And Democrats will immediately halt enforcement of and rescind the Trump Administration’s un-American immigrant wealth test.
EN_M_011	22	Even as we work to reverse the enormous damage caused by the Trump Administration, we are determined to build a 21st century immigration system that embodies our values, expands economic opportunity for all Americans, and enhances our global competitiveness.
EN_M_011	23	Democrats believe family unity should be a guiding principle for our immigration policy.
EN_M_011	24	We will prioritize family reunification for children still separated from their families, and we will restore family reunification programs ended by the Trump Administration.
EN_M_011	25	We support legislation to treat the spouses and children of green card holders as immediate relatives and end their unfair separation.
EN_M_011	26	We will eliminate family-based green card backlogs and reform the system to speed up family-based visas.
EN_M_011	27	And we will work with Congress to eliminate immigration barriers, such as the three- and 10-year bars, and remove the 10-year waiting period for waivers to the permanent bars that keep loved ones apart.
EN_M_011	28	We will ensure that enforcement mechanisms are humane and consistent with our values and international humanitarian obligations.
EN_M_011	29	That’s why we will end workplace and community raids.
EN_M_011	30	We will protect sensitive locations like our schools, houses of worship, health care facilities, benefits offices, and DMVs from immigration enforcement actions, and prohibit raids in which children and members of vulnerable populations are left behind without their caregivers.
EN_M_011	31	We will prohibit enforcement actions that deter access to justice at courthouses and repress freedom of speech and assembly, end programs that force state and local law enforcement to also be responsible for immigration enforcement, and stop targeting men and women who served in uniform and their families.
EN_M_011	32	We will reaffirm enforcement officials’ ability to engage in the pre-Trump practice of prosecutorial discretion for deserving cases, including when needed to address humanitarian issues or other injustices.
EN_M_011	33	We will also prevent enforcement officials from retaliating against individuals for their political speech or activity, or because of their efforts to advocate for individuals’ rights.
EN_M_013	1	Ireland is a small open economy that looks outwards in its ambitions.
EN_M_013	2	We have thrived and prospered by fully engaging with the EU and international trade.
EN_M_013	3	Our capacity to sustain a thriving SME sector and remain a key destination for Foreign Direct Investment will be vital to our future economic success.
EN_M_013	4	Ireland cannot become over reliant on multi-nationals at the expense of cultivating our indigenous SME sector.
EN_M_013	5	Furthermore, SMEs face a crisis in accessing affordable insurance.
EN_M_013	6	The last decade has seen the Government let its policy focus on SMEs drift in priority compared to multinationals.
EN_M_013	7	The OECD review of government SME policy clearly shows that Irish SMEs have low start up and productivity rates; poor uptake in management training and adoption of digital technologies, while underachieving in share of R&D business.
EN_M_013	8	Most damming of all, our indigenous enterprises are not active in international markets, with only 6% of Irish SMEs directly trading across borders.
EN_M_013	9	We will change this and allow the 250,000 indigenous businesses located in every village, town and city nationwide every opportunity to prosper.
EN_M_013	10	Building a strong economy is the basis for a strong society.
EN_M_013	11	This means creating decent jobs with decent pay across the whole country.
EN_M_013	12	Our economy must be founded on jobs that give workers a decent wage to raise a family, own their own home and lead a dignified life throughout all of Ireland not just a small part of it.
EN_M_013	13	Fianna Fáil is committed to building a framework that promotes balanced regional development, develops a thriving SME sector, continues to attract Foreign Direct Investment and sustains decent employment standards.
EN_M_013	14	Over the next five years we will: Reduce CGT from 33% to 25%.
EN_M_013	15	Investment is vital to enabling companies to grow and expand or for start-up companies to get off the ground.
EN_M_013	16	Reducing the CGT rate will help to incentivise investment and free up more money to be put into new companies, creating more jobs and broadening our tax base.
EN_M_013	17	We will reduce the CGT rate from 33% to 25%.
EN_M_013	18	This measure will cost €267m.
EN_M_013	19	We will increase the lifetime limit of Entrepreneurial Relief to €15m.
EN_M_013	20	This measure will cost €84m.
EN_M_013	21	Equalise the tax treatment of the self-employed
EN_M_013	22	Self-employed people who have started their own small business are still discriminated against in the current tax system.
EN_M_013	23	Unlike PAYE workers they do not receive the full benefit of the €1,650 Tax credit.
EN_M_013	24	Their hard-earned income is subjected to an even higher effective tax rate, ignoring the impact they have on the broader economy and community.
EN_M_013	25	We will build on the progress Fianna Fáil secured on this over the past several budgets and fully equalise tax treatment.We will equalise tax treatment for the self- employed by extending the earned tax credit to €1,650.
EN_M_013	26	This measure will cost €35m.
EN_M_013	27	Enhance the employment and investment incentive scheme
EN_M_013	28	Ensuring access to competitive funding sources is a key enterprise priority.
EN_M_013	29	The employment and investment incentive scheme (EIIS) incentivises private investors to put equity into SMEs.
EN_M_013	30	However, the current €250,000 cap on investments is hindering further funding to qualifying companies under the scheme.
EN_M_013	31	In the UK, the limit on investors is £1 million under their equivalent EIIS scheme.
EN_M_013	32	As another Brexit competitiveness measure and to further promote entrepreneurship.We will increase the annual current EIIS ceiling to €1m as an initial policy measure.
EN_M_013	33	This measure will cost €0.86m.
EN_M_013	34	Reform the R&D Tax Credit and the Key Employee Engagement Programme for SMEs
EN_M_013	35	It is essential to intensify uptake in R&D (research and development) activities by Irish SMEs.
EN_M_013	36	Developing new products and pioneering innovation is key to continued jobs and investment.
EN_M_013	37	However, there is a deficit in R&D activity by domestic SMEs with multinationals dominating the arena.
EN_M_013	38	We will: Introduce a pre-approval mechanism for the R&D tax credit specifically designed for micro and small businesses.
EN_M_013	39	This will reduce the risk facing SMEs and match the offering in the UK.
EN_M_013	40	Include a review of the KEEP scheme along with the SME tax environment as part of the Commission on Taxation.
EN_M_013	41	Introduce an ambitious National SME Masterplan to 2030
EN_M_013	42	In the 1950s, Seán Lemass set out a radical plan for increased FDI that has benefited the economy to the present day.
EN_M_013	43	Irish small businesses now require the same strategic focus to be set out in a national SME masterplan.
EN_M_013	44	This will set out a new visionary long-term strategic blueprint to recast SME policy in Ireland for the next decade, one which engenders pro-enterprise and pro- entrepreneur policies.
EN_M_013	45	The productivity gap between SMEs and foreign multinationals is very pronounced in Ireland.
EN_M_013	46	Ireland’s SMEs are the second lowest performing in the OECD.
EN_M_013	47	This is a glaring deficit overseen by Fine Gael over the last decade.
EN_M_013	48	We will:
EN_M_013	49	Double the value of trading online vouchers up to €5,000 that LEOs provide to start ups and micro sized firms.
EN_M_013	50	Expand Enterprise Ireland’s Exporter Development Department staff contingent to 20 Strengthen InterTrade Ireland’s vital Acumen and Elevate programmes, which support SMEs to develop cross-border business by increasing funding.
EN_M_013	51	We have strongly campaigned for a social safety net to be extended to Irish job creators if their business fails.
EN_M_013	52	It secures a measure of social justice and reduces the risk for those entrepreneurs who wish to start up their own businesses.
EN_M_013	53	We will expand more social protection supports to our entrepreneurs by ensuring that PRSI contributors are eligible for the carers’ benefit.
EN_M_013	54	This will benefit in the region of 400 self-employed persons in the first year of take up.
EN_M_021	1	A Labour government will establish a humane immigration system and end the ‘hostile environment’ that caused the Windrush scandal of British citizens being deported.
EN_M_021	2	Instead, our system will be built on human rights and aimed at meeting the skills and labour shortages that exist in our economy and public services.
EN_M_021	3	Our immigration system must allow us to recruit the people we need, and to welcome them and their families.
EN_M_021	4	Our work visa system must fill any skills or labour shortages that arise.
EN_M_021	5	The movement of people around the world has enriched our society, our economy and our culture.
EN_M_021	6	We will take decisive action to regulate the labour market to stop the undercutting of wages and conditions, and the exploitation of all workers including migrant workers.
EN_M_021	7	It is the actions of bad bosses and successive Conservative governments that have driven down wages and working terms and conditions.
EN_M_021	8	Labour will ensure all workers have full and equal rights from day one, with a Real Living Wage for all.
EN_M_021	9	The Conservative policy of pursuing net migration targets has undermined our economy and our public services, refusing entry to essential key workers including nurses.
EN_M_021	10	It has created a hostile environment within our communities, encouraged the demonisation of migrants and enabled the callous use of three million residents as bargaining chips in our negotiations over EU withdrawal.
EN_M_021	11	We are for a levelling up of rights, not a race to the bottom.
EN_M_021	12	We will not tolerate a two-tier system for those entitled to be here.
EN_M_021	13	The Windrush scandal continues to create new victims.
EN_M_021	14	We will end its injustices and provide fair compensation to those who have unfairly suffered.
EN_M_021	15	We will end indefinite detention, review the alternatives to the inhumane conditions of detention centres, and close Yarl’s Wood and Brook House, from which immediate savings would contribute towards a fund of £20 million to support the survivors of modern slavery, people trafficking and domestic violence.
EN_M_021	16	We will ensure justice for migrant domestic workers and restore the overseas domestic workers’ visa.
EN_M_021	17	If we remain in the EU, freedom of movement would continue.
EN_M_021	18	If we leave, it will be subject to negotiations, but we recognise the social and economic benefits that free movement has brought both in terms of EU citizens here and UK citizens abroad – and we will seek to protect those rights.
EN_M_021	19	In accordance with our values and domestic laws, we will uphold the right to a family life for British, EU and non-EU residents alike.
EN_M_021	20	We will end the deportation of family members of people entitled to be here and end the minimum income requirements which separate families.
EN_M_021	21	Refugees are victims of wars, environmental catastrophes, famine or persecution.
EN_M_021	22	This government has failed its international legal obligations to refugees and to allow people to exercise their rights to seek asylum.
EN_M_021	23	A Labour government will uphold those rights and meet those obligations.
EN_M_021	24	We will work with others to resume rescue missions in the Mediterranean, co-operate with the French authorities to put an end to the horrific camps, and establish safe and legal routes for asylum seekers.
EN_M_021	25	Once here, refugees will have the right to work, access to public services and will be treated humanely by government at all levels.
EN_M_032	1	Defence Force primary functions are to defend the State against armed aggression, provide maritime security and fishery protection, air ambulance and other cover and has also been tasked with participating in multinational peace and humanitarian relief operations across the globe in support of the United Nations.
EN_M_032	2	Sinn Féin commend the lifesaving work undertaken by our navy in the Mediterranean Sea.
EN_M_032	3	In Government, we will ensure that the Irish navy plays an active role in search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean and will support NGO efforts in this vital work as well.
EN_M_032	4	Ireland has a long and proud tradition of constructive neutrality.
EN_M_032	5	Unfortunately, this bedrock of Irish foreign policy has been undermined by successive Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil led Governments.
EN_M_032	6	Sinn Féin will ensure that our neutrality is restored and seek to have it enshrined in the Constitution, thus allowing our Defence Forces to continue its important role as peacekeepers across the globe.
EN_M_032	7	In recent years, due to Government cuts, there has been a decline in Defence Forces numbers, a marginalising of the Reserve Defence Forces and a declining morale among members, due in no small measures to the lack of appropriate pay and conditions.
EN_M_032	8	The untenable pay and conditions for current members of the Defence Forces must be addressed.
EN_M_032	9	Urgent action is required to ensure Defence Forces personnel can fully carry out allotted tasks and to do this they must receive fair pay to ensure the better retention of current members and new recruits and that they feel respected and are no longer required to sleep on ships to save rents or take out second jobs or personal loans to cover basic living requirements.
EN_M_032	10	Defence priorities: Restoring Irish neutrality and independent foreign policy.
EN_M_032	11	Setting up a pay review commission on defence members pay in the first six months of a new Government tasked with establishing fair remuneration for the defence forces.
EN_M_032	12	Roll out a plan for the implementation of the Organisation of Working Time Act (OWTA) for the Defence Forces.
EN_M_032	13	Giving Defence Forces unions the right to collectively bargain on pay, terms and conditions issues and affiliate to ICTU.
EN_M_032	14	Increasing member numbers year on year to rebuild the Defence Forces to a baseline figure of 9,500 members.
EN_M_032	15	Introducing a capital investment programme for upgrading of current barracks infrastructure prioritising living quarters from the outset.
EN_M_032	16	Allowing for a voluntary extension period of up to five years subject to a fitness to serve criteria allowing Defence Forces members to serve beyond the current age limit.
EN_M_032	17	Initiate a root and branch review of the current Department of Defence and instigate reforms to improve the working relationship between the Department and the defence forces structures and particularly around responsibility for budget spending.
EN_M_032	18	Immediately draw up a plan of action to help alleviate and address the ongoing health problems of Defence Forces personnel suffering as a result of being forced to take the anti-malaria drug Lariam.
EN_M_032	19	Automatically granting a medical card to any Defence Forces member who has to leave the force due to a medical condition.
BG_001	1	A refugee came from Ukraine, in our country they make her life even worse
BG_001	2	A refugee from Ukraine revealed the absurdities of the Bulgarian administration in accepting victims of the military conflict.
BG_001	3	Xenia Butova has been on our territory for several days, insisting on refugee status so that she can settle in our country.
BG_001	4	She arrives from Varna, but although there is a migration centre there, she is forced to travel to Sofia to start the procedure for herself.
BG_001	5	"""Yes, they know about D-visa entry, but they are not given any instructions or authority there."
BG_001	6	That's why I had to drive to Sofia to get to the reception centre in Ovcha Kupel.
BG_001	7	It looks like a dormitory with bars on the windows.
BG_001	8	There is only one shopkeeper at the entrance.
BG_001	9	After I crossed the yard, I found an employee.
BG_001	10	"I had to bring a valid passport,"" she says."
BG_001	11	She describes the step-by-step process that must be followed by her and her compatriots who would seek protection in Bulgaria: First, a form must be filled out, which must be in Bulgarian.
BG_001	12	This is where online translators come in.
BG_001	13	It is necessary to write an English phone number for contact, as well as an address.
BG_001	14	It is not clear what happens to those refugees who have neither a place to stay nor a Bulgarian mobile operator card.
BG_001	15	A copy of the passavana shall be provided.
BG_001	16	From there on, the actual registration begins, which requires the presence of an interpreter, which is very likely not to be available at the reception centre at the moment.
BG_001	17	"""I'm lucky that I know English, so I was able to talk to the director of the centre on the phone and she helped me get an interpreter for a few hours,"" says Xenia."
BG_001	18	If she had not done so, she would have been forced to return to Varna and from there to wait for an unknown time for an invitation for an interview in Sofia.
BG_001	19	During registration, refugees are asked about relatives, education, family...
BG_001	20	All this is entered into a database, and then their fingerprints are taken for biometrics.
BG_001	21	"They are then issued a ""green card"" with a passport-size photograph."
BG_001	22	And the passport itself is taken away.
BG_001	23	This registration allows refugees to choose a personal doctor and open a bank account in the country.
BG_001	24	However, according to Butova, the banks themselves are not aware of their rights and refuse.
BG_001	25	Her experience from yesterday is with 2 financial institutions in our country.
BG_001	26	"""Once they give you the document, you are not allowed to leave the country, otherwise you lose your refugee status,"" Xenia says."
BG_001	27	An interview follows, for which a sworn interpreter must also be provided.
BG_001	28	"""They say that after it, the procedure takes between 3 and 6 months."
BG_001	29	And it is not clear whether the decision of the Bulgarian authorities will be a permission or a denial of status.
BG_001	30	"However, if the case drags on for more than 3 months, the refugee has the right to start working,"" the Ukrainian adds."
BG_001	31	If a Ukrainian decides to enter the country without claiming refugee status, he is entitled to stay for up to 90 days, after which he can request an extension for another 90.
BG_001	32	Bulgarian Georgi Georgiev travelled many kilometres to save his children from the war in Ukraine.
BG_001	33	"""The Ukrainian border was closed."
BG_001	34	The Ukrainians could not pass.
BG_001	35	People were trying to break through the cordon.
BG_001	36	There was a lack of organization.
BG_001	37	I expect a humanitarian crisis.
BG_001	38	"There is nowhere to buy food at the border,"" the man told NOVA."
BG_001	39	We remind you that since last night Ukrainians from different parts of the country started arriving in Bulgaria.
BG_001	40	A queue of cars forms on the Danube Bridge.
BG_007	1	Tomislav Donchev:
BG_007	2	In two or three weeks we will announce our presidential candidate
BG_007	3	"""It is certain that this parliament has done very little"", Donchev analysed the work of the parliament."
BG_007	4	"""It's hard for me to define what was the funniest and most tragic."
BG_007	5	In terms of the number of MPs, we are a quarter of the whole parliament.
BG_007	6	We can't even do statistics on who has taken how many breaks so we can be blamed for delaying work.
BG_007	7	We may have slowed down sometimes, but sometimes we've picked it up.
BG_007	8	"We also had good proposals, some of which were accepted and others not."""
BG_007	9	Tomislav Donchev also commented on the issue of GERB's candidacy for the upcoming presidential elections.
BG_007	10	At the moment we cannot say who the candidate will be because the internal nomination procedure is not over, he explained.
BG_007	11	"""Management, of course, can judge and choose."
BG_007	12	Consultations and nominations are ongoing, and I hope we will make the best decision.
BG_007	13	"I think there is still enough time for that."""
BG_007	14	The deputy chairman of GERB also said to what extent it was possible the candidate to be Boyko Borissov.
BG_007	15	It is rather impossible that our candidate in these elections is Boyko Borissov, said Tomislav Donchev.
BG_007	16	"""There's a long list of reasons for that."
BG_007	17	At the very least, he should be the leader of his party.
BG_007	18	A presidential candidate worthy of the support of all our supporters and sympathizers must be elected.
BG_007	19	A candidate to fill this position with substance, to step into this role that the constitution assigns him.
BG_007	20	To be a balancer, to calm political passions when necessary.
BG_007	21	Yes, Borissov would be up to the task, but in this election I don't think it should be him and it will be him.
BG_007	22	It is possible to be both a party figure and an expert.
BG_007	23	We have good short list offerings both as a party figure and not.
BG_007	24	To me, he should not be a party lackey and not a party member.
BG_007	25	We have two main candidates and one in reserve.
BG_007	26	By definition, the president has a partisan genesis.
BG_007	27	He is endorsed by a party, but too much party color is not the best way to get into a presidential run.
BG_007	28	It is better not to be so partisan.
BG_007	29	It's entirely possible that we'll go for a woman, but our candidate is more likely to be a man.
BG_007	30	I hope very soon, if not at the next elections, Bulgaria will be ready to elect a woman.
BG_007	31	I have already said that there are processes of nominations and discussion in the structures.
BG_007	32	Three weeks from now our candidate will be clear.
BG_007	33	Politically, I don't think it's a problem or a challenge that the election will be 2 in 1, as a budget burden it's the better option.
BG_007	34	"One more thing, the scenario of getting people to vote for weeks on end exhausts their patience."""
BG_007	35	Tomislav Donchev also commented on his expectations for the next parliament and GERB's possible partners there.
BG_007	36	It is very important who is the first political force he pointed out. - Making a coalition in a National Assembly is not an easy task.
BG_007	37	First you have to find a line of agreement, then convince one or two forces to be of one mind, to gather energy.
BG_007	38	The coalition options are clearly not infinitely wide.
BG_007	39	In this last National Assembly, I did not understand who wanted to talk to whom and what difference that made when talking.
BG_007	40	"All past events like the 46th National Assembly should be a lesson for politicians and people""."
BG_007	41	Tomislav Donchev also commented on how hot is the relationship between GERB and the prosecutor general.
BG_007	42	I could hardly comment on Ivan Geshev and his correspondence with Boyko Borissov's PR, Donchev said. - From a photo that appeared, there is nothing to comment.
BG_007	43	Let one of the two comment on it.
BG_007	44	I can't confirm that there has been any communication.
BG_007	45	And like you I've seen pictures on a phone.
BG_007	46	It is not hygienic to delve into other people's correspondence.
BG_007	47	Clearly it is of interest but I don't think we have anything to comment on.
BG_007	48	I don't think the Attorney General has any relationships with parties.
BG_007	49	He may have historically had relationships institutionally with party members.
BG_007	50	I don't think there should be that relationship either.
BG_007	51	Otherwise, on a budget, according to tradition or legislation, there can be no wedding or engagement between three.
BG_007	52	This is done between two.
BG_007	53	"In Parliament, you can vote for, against and abstain."""
BG_007	54	It is normal to have a party out of six parties voting like another.
BG_007	55	Intensive support for pensioners in the crisis, a longer debate on how to make pension reform look better.
BG_007	56	This is what we were hoping for.
BG_007	57	"It turned out that there was more support in the House for the proposal for 120 lv per month of support and so it happened""."
BG_022	1	CHRONOLOGY OF THE LARGEST
BG_022	2	FRAUD IN HISTORY
BG_022	3	MARCH 2020
BG_022	4	"""We need to shut you down for 3 weeks (21 days) to protect health systems that would otherwise collapse."" 3 MONTHS LATER: ""We are working on a vaccine that will crush the virus"" (respiratory virus!!!)."
BG_022	5	"It will only be given to people from vulnerable groups."""
BG_022	6	"CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT AT RISK. 6 MONTHS LATER: ""The virus is mutating and we will have to work on herd immunity, i.e. expand the scope of 'vulnerable groups'."
BG_022	7	"Vaccination will be entirely voluntary. ""12 MONTHS LATER: ""We are starting the vaccination campaign and we should pay no attention to the anti-vaxxers!"""
BG_022	8	"""We all have a duty to society...."" and so on."
BG_022	9	"Preparations are underway to further expand the ""vulnerable groups"" by adding children 12-18 and children 5-12 years of age. 16 MONTHS LATER: ""We cannot avoid the introduction of a green passport/certificate!"
BG_022	10	Vaccination will not be compulsory, but we cannot allow anyone to endanger the public.
BG_022	11	"20 MONTHS LATER: The rhetoric is getting more and more strident - the ""concerned"" are now calling the ""anti-vaxxers"" ""angels of death"" (this is an official statement by a politician from Western Europe)."
BG_022	12	Armed with assault rifles!!!
BG_022	13	police officers check customers at a shoe shop in a major European capital for a green passport.
BG_022	14	And they attack with water jets and smoke grenades the people sitting in the square, peacefully protesting and reading prayers!
BG_022	15	"""The booster dose will now be compulsory for all stabbings so far and we will do it every 4-6 months."""
BG_022	16	After nearly 600 days /not 21 days/ it turned out that: - Not a single new hospital was built in Europe, in countries whose health systems were supposedly about to collapse in March 2020.
BG_022	17	But instead billions of euros have been poured into tests, checkpoints, vaccine ads and so on!
BG_022	18	- An incredible EIGHT TRILLION EURO have been distributed and absorbed through fiscal incentives to date!
BG_022	19	"- ""Temporary inflation"" has made life even more expensive than before."
BG_022	20	In short, if you're a shareholder of Louis Vuitton or you're Bill Gates & Co, your money has grown 200% in 12 months.
BG_022	21	If you're a regular person who wants to buy eggs and bread and pay for your electricity - congratulations, your money has depreciated by 20%!
BG_022	22	"- Vaccination is still done on an interesting ""voluntary basis"", where you are responsible in case something happens to you during the experiment."
BG_022	23	Although we are told that there are no contraindications and side effects.
BG_022	24	"In short, if you die - there is no way that your family can seek compensation from either the manufacturer or the caring WHO and the parent state that has introduced this ""voluntary principle""."
BG_022	25	"That's it - you die and your partner and children have to deal with the grief and the ""temporary inflation""!"
BG_022	26	"- Despite the glaring need for medics and nurses, it actually turns out that it's not a problem to fire everyone who doesn't ""volunteer"" to get vaccinated!"
BG_022	27	"- Somewhere out there, however, all the football championships, Olympics and other spectacles continue to go on full steam amidst ""the worst pandemic since the dawn of mankind""!"
BG_022	28	- in India, half the population did not die, as Deutsche Welle and CNN tried to convince us in early 2021.
BG_022	29	"But the problems in Denmark and Norway - and not only - with vaccination rates above 85%, necessitate ""further restrictive measures"" at the moment"
BG_026	1	The Regional Minister:
BG_026	2	Do we want a highway to run into the dunes
BG_026	3	Let's ask the citizens - do we want a highway to run into the sands like this
BG_026	4	Minister of Regional Development and Public Works Petya Avramova commented on the legal obligation of the state to expropriate the dunes, which are located in private properties.
BG_026	5	So far, the state has not started any procedure for expropriation of dunes.
BG_026	6	To expropriate all the sands, about 1 billion BGN is needed, Avramova said.
BG_026	7	The government allocated a little more (BGN 1.35 billion) at the end of last year for the completion of the Hemus motorway from the Boaza junction to the Veliko Tarnovo interchange.
BG_026	8	More than 70 percent of the dunes fall on private property.
BG_026	9	This happened back in time, long before GERB came to power.
BG_026	10	The process started in 1991 with the restoration of agricultural land and the acquisition of ownership of the land under the Land Restitution Act.
BG_026	11	That is, before the specialised Black Sea Coast Act was adopted.
BG_026	12	The land conversion and the building permits issued also date back to before GERB came to power in 2009.
BG_026	13	This became clear from the explanations of the regional minister on the occasion of the inquiry of the GERB deputies what measures the ministry has taken regarding the recent cases of building on the Black Sea coast of the so-called.
BG_026	14	"Driver's beach near ""Aleppo"", the camping ""Garden"", the obliteration of the dunes of the camping ""Fig"" and others."
BG_026	15	Avramova replied that an inter-ministerial working group was established by her order of 4 February 2019.
BG_026	16	Within two months, it must address all the problems with the development along the Black Sea coast, including those with the dunes.
BG_026	17	This is yet another working group that is created after every attempt to build on the sands of the Black Sea coast, which are documented as agricultural land.
BG_026	18	"""The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works is purposefully and continuously working on the problem of illegal and excessive construction on the Black Sea coast,"" Petya Avramova was quoted by BTA as saying."
BG_026	19	She pointed out that even after the first signals for violations on the Black Sea coast the head of the National Construction Control Directorate of the State National Construction Inspectorate Arch.
BG_026	20	Ivan Nestorov has carried out emergency spot checks.
BG_026	21	Where violations have been found, the result to date is the suspension or freezing of construction, Avramova recalled.
BG_026	22	"Regarding the destruction of dunes at the camping ""Gradina"" in the municipality of Sozopol, Avramova explained that this is a criminal act and is not within the competence of the Ministry of Regional Development."
BG_026	23	"Regarding the expropriation of the dunes by the state, Avramova pointed out that it should be assessed ""whether it makes sense"" to take measures against dunes of 100 square meters, located on a construction site of 40 acres."
BG_026	24	"The example she gave corresponds to the case of the project for a villa settlement ""Coral Residence"" in the land of the declared eco-plage ""Coral"" of the investor Sava Choroleev."
BG_026	25	He announced that he was willing to return the property to the State for a fee if the State felt it was important to them and wanted to leave it for public use.
BG_026	26	"Asked by ""Club Z"" whether the state is considering this proposal against the backdrop that there is nothing ""eco"" on a legally declared ecological beach, centimeters away from which there is a resort complex, Avramova replied, ""If the citizens say we should buy the land, we should also ask them if they want a highway to run in the sands."""
BG_026	27	Avramova reiterated that despite the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) last month, which gave the green light for the construction of Coral Residence, the ban of the Ministry of Environment and Water for construction in the land of Coral is still in force.
BG_027	1	President Rumen Radev called for clear criteria and a transparent procedure in the selection of a new Prosecutor General
BG_027	2	"President Rumen Radev opened a round table on ""Upcoming election of the Prosecutor General - criteria and public expectations""."
BG_027	3	It was attended by representatives of the non-governmental sector - organizations related to the judiciary and professional organizations of lawyers.
BG_027	4	During the discussion the Head of State called for clear criteria, a transparent procedure and good arguments for the nominations for the next prosecutor general.
BG_027	5	"""The Prosecutor General is entrusted with high public expectations, he will have difficult tasks ahead of him, so it is important that he enjoys high public trust from the very beginning of his activity,"" Rumen Radev said."
BG_027	6	The President pointed out that the high expectations for the procedure were necessary and justified given the functions assigned to the Prosecutor General by the Constitution - to supervise the rule of law and provide methodological guidance to all prosecutors.
BG_027	7	"""This is an important factor for an effective fight against crime, corruption and the strengthening of the rule of law,"" the Head of State added."
BG_027	8	He raised the question of the specific measures of the selection criteria provided for in the law - high ethical standards, high professional competence, demonstrated independence and will to enforce the law.
BG_027	9	"""It is important how the independence of the next Prosecutor General will be assessed because the success of his future activity depends on his courage and civic responsibility,"" Rumen Radev said."
BG_027	10	He pointed out that he was far from thinking that he was exceeding his powers with the talks on the election of a new attorney general.
BG_027	11	"""I am guided only by the principle of separation of powers, but I do not neglect my duty to sign a decree at the end of the process."
BG_027	12	"For me, the most important thing is that society has a focus on these processes and that there is increased public attention,"" the President further said."
BG_027	13	Rumen Radev has already held meetings on the issue with the Prosecutor General Sotir Tsatsarov, the Presidents of the SCC and the SAC - Lozan Panov and Georgi Cholakov, with the Minister of Justice Danail Kirilov, with the Chief Inspector of the Inspectorate of the SJC Teodora Tochkova and with the representative of the SJC Boyan Magdalinchev.
BG_027	14	In the Head of State's words, these consultations are a clear signal of the great importance of the election of the next Prosecutor General and the need for this event to be in the focus of public attention.
BG_027	15	The procedure for electing a new Attorney General will start on 15 July.
BG_027	16	On November 14 will be the hearing of the candidates and the first vote for the candidates at a plenary meeting of the Supreme Judicial Council.
BG_027	17	The President has the final say on the approval of the chosen candidate.
BG_028	1	The Prime Minister received the nurses who spent the night in front of the Medical Council
BG_028	2	Prime Minister Boyko Borissov received this evening representatives of the protesting nurses who spent the night in front of the Council of Ministers.
BG_028	3	On Sunday, they went on a protest, which turned into a midnight tent camp in front of the Council of Ministers, which continued throughout the day on Monday.
BG_028	4	The nurses insist on a meeting with Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, to whom they sent a letter earlier last week to inform him of their demands for reforms to overcome the collapse of the health system.
BG_028	5	Initially, the Council of Ministers announced that it would receive them on Tuesday, but this did not satisfy them and they continued to insist that the meeting be on Monday.
BG_028	6	It was eventually scheduled for 6.30 pm.
BG_028	7	"At 18:50 the head of the government press service, Sevdelina Arnaudova, announced on her personal Facebook page that ""there are still no representatives of the protesting nurses""."
BG_028	8	She published several photos - the first two show the prime minister on the terrace of the Council of Ministers, looking at the tents of the sisters.
BG_028	9	The other photos were taken in his office, where he, Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev, Health Minister Kiril Ananiev and the new Social Minister Denitsa Sacheva are.
BG_028	10	Earlier, the leader of the protests and chairwoman of the newly formed Syndicate of Medical Professionals Maya Ilieva vowed together with her colleagues not to leave until they are accepted.
BG_028	11	"Let's hope he has the courage to meet some screaming women"" The main demands of the specialists are reform and a new funding model for hospitals."
BG_028	12	Since the beginning of their protests in March, they have been against the commercial status of medical institutions, as well as against the existing funding model, as the treatment of the sick has become a trade.
BG_028	13	"""Under the current model, the NHIF is being drained of public funds."
BG_028	14	"Patients in many cases are no longer treated according to a diagnosis, but according to a clinical pathway and how much it costs"" , believes Maya Ilieva."
BG_028	15	Representatives of the protesters have sent a letter to the prime minister demanding a meeting where they can receive guarantees that their demands will be met.
BG_028	16	"""We are turning to you once again in the hope that you will give us the opportunity to tell you from the first person about what is happening in the hospitals and various health structures in Bulgaria."
BG_028	17	On 16.12. we will be in front of the Council of Ministers.
BG_028	18	We are the representatives of the medical professionals who for the tenth month have been doing everything possible to alert the institutions about the collapse of the health system.
BG_028	19	Our profession is subjected to absolute genocide!
BG_028	20	We are forced to work ourselves to exhaustion and out of a job due to lack of staff, poor working conditions and paltry pay!
BG_028	21	We do not intend to complain, we intend to fight!
BG_028	22	You give the appearance of a serious man who keeps his word!
BG_028	23	But we are serious women who give our lives every day to help people and we deserve at least a casual conversation with you.
BG_028	24	Show us that there is a working institution in Bulgaria that would listen to the voice of some worthy women!
BG_028	25	"We believe that you are the only guarantor for the fulfilment of the commitments made by Minister Ananiev,"" reads the sisters' letter to the Prime Minister."
BG_030	1	Valery Simeonov:
BG_030	2	I cannot accept the second phase of my demonization
BG_030	3	Deputy Speaker of Parliament Valeri Simeonov called this morning to stop the protests of mothers of children with disabilities against his election to the post of a
BG_030	4	Because of the exchange of remarks with them he was forced to resign as deputy prime minister.
BG_030	5	"Simeonov believes that the renewed civil action against him is unfounded and goes as far as his ""demonisation""."
BG_030	6	"""I am offended, I am sick when I am told that I am a man with no senses for the tragedy and pain of these women,"" Valeri Simeonov told Nova TV."
BG_030	7	"""I can't accept that there will be a second phase of demonizing me and making me public enemy number one."
BG_030	8	"I paid my price,"" he added."
BG_030	9	"Simeonov called the protests ""understandable and expected""."
BG_030	10	He added that participants have the right to demonstrate.
BG_030	11	He recalled that they had already achieved their goal with his resignation from the deputy prime minister's post and the adoption of the three laws they had insisted on.
BG_030	12	"""I'm different as a politician, I use harsher expressions...Perhaps I'm most aware of the pain of these mothers simply because I have people with disabilities in my life,"" Simeonov added."
BG_030	13	He told us that he has been taking care of his mother for seven years now, who is immobilized after a severe stroke.
BG_030	14	"The deputy speaker of parliament believes that his ""harsher"" phrases are used by his political opponents, thus causing sentiments against him."
BG_030	15	"According to Simeonov, ""it is not right"" for people with disabilities to attack him today with ""political demands"" because his election as vice-president is completely legitimate."
BG_030	16	He is a member of parliament because 320 000 people voted for him.
BG_030	17	"He called the MRF's protests against his election a ""compliment""."
BG_030	18	He does not accept moral assessments to be given by a person who has a very immoral past, specifying that he is referring to the MP from MRF Yordan Tsonev.
BG_030	19	"Simeonov said that he was not ""clinging at all costs"" to the position of deputy speaker of the National Assembly."
BG_030	20	"He pointed out that ""long before he entered politics"", as a businessman in Burgas he had helped many people."
BG_030	21	He gave the example of paying a lawyer for six Bulgarian sailors to be released from a Greek prison, he has also helped at least two seriously ill people to have operations.
BG_030	22	Valeri Simeonov supports the idea of Sofia Mayor Yordanka Fandakova to raise taxes on older and more powerful cars because of their greater contribution to air pollution.
BG_030	23	"""This is an unpleasant, painful but necessary measure,"" Simeonov said."
BG_030	24	Valeri Simeonov defended his proposal to introduce regulation for renting rooms to tourists through online platforms like Airbnb.
BG_030	25	"""Is the state pretending not to see the lawlessness and can it provide a level playing field for all those engaged in the hospitality business?"" he asked."
BG_030	26	He pointed out that it is a violation of the law to engage in commercial activity without paying taxes.
BG_030	27	"He pointed out that France and the Netherlands already regulate Airbnb and Romania ""is preparing changes to the law just like ours""."
BG_030	28	Valery Simeonov denies that there is a conflict of interest regarding the proposal.
BG_030	29	"The reason for this claim is that his TV ""SKAT"" has a hotel in Malko Tarnovo."
BG_031	1	With the help of the MRF, F-16s flew through parliamentary committees
BG_031	2	The ruling party pushed the government's proposal to start negotiations with the US on the purchase of F-16 fighter jets through the parliamentary defence and finance committees.
BG_031	3	The cabinet's proposal is expected to be voted in plenary as the first item on the agenda as early as Wednesday.
BG_031	4	The meeting of the parliamentary committee on defence was closed despite the BSP's request that it be postponed and the left's attempts to cause a scandal with allegations that its MPs were not familiar with all the documents surrounding the preparation of the project.
BG_031	5	"Military Minister Krassimir Karakachanov explained that only the BSP MPs and ""that party, I keep forgetting its name, I keep confusing it with a company"" - the formation of Veselin Mareshki, who is in sharp personal conflict with the military minister, voted against the proposal."
BG_031	6	"According to information from MPs, seven representatives of BSP and one of ""Volya"" voted against the proposal.Karakachanov commented that he expects the MRF to support the proposal in the plenary, so there should be no problems with its adoption."
BG_031	7	"""I expect that their parliamentary group will repeat the vote of their colleagues on the committee,"" he said."
BG_031	8	In addition to starting negotiations with the US, the cabinet proposes to allow a deviation from the current requirements of the project.
BG_031	9	The proposal is expected to pass through Parliament without edits, as it did in the parliamentary committees.
BG_031	10	"The ""deviations"" The initial US offer for new F-16 fighter jets exceeds the budget ceiling of 1.8 billion leva including VAT."
BG_031	11	In response to a question, Karakachanov laconically confirmed that it exceeds the ceiling by less than 300 million leva, which unofficial information has already come out.
BG_031	12	"""The deviation that can be made is up to the maximum value of the offer at the time,"" he explained."
BG_031	13	The war minister, however, expects the price to fall within the framework of negotiations with the US, as US officials have committed.
BG_031	14	In addition to increasing the price, the Parliament will also allow the first fighter jets to be delivered later than 2 years after the signing of the contract, which was the previous requirement.
BG_031	15	In addition, a new repayment scheme may be sought in the negotiations.
BG_031	16	Bulgaria insists this to be deferred over the next 10 years, but it is possible that if sanctioned by the finance ministry they will be paid over a shorter period.
BG_031	17	Quick negotiations with no appeal option.
BG_031	18	Karakachanov commented that he expects the procedure to be completed in 3-4 months and an agreement to be reached, although the practice in such inter-state negotiations is for them to last longer.
BG_031	19	If Karakachanov's plan comes to fruition, the deal could be signed before the European Parliament elections.
BG_031	20	He noted that there is no procedure by which a military treaty between two governments can be challenged in international institutions and courts.
BG_031	21	The main US competitor for the order - Sweden and SAAB - remained disappointed with the Bulgarian decision and announced that the US proposal did not meet the Bulgarian requirements.
BG_031	22	However, according to the government, none of the bids submitted fully meet these requirements, and if the variance is not accepted, the project must begin again.
BG_031	23	Attempted scandal.
BG_031	24	The meeting of the parliamentary defence committee started with a scandal provoked by the BSP.
BG_031	25	The Left Party asked the meeting to be postponed or to be opened.
BG_031	26	BSP deputy Slavcho Velkov said that the representatives of the left were not familiar with the report of the political-military group that prepared the project.
BG_031	27	"Deputy Military Minister Atanas Zapryanov explained that all the findings have already been submitted to the National Assembly, but Velkov insisted that ""this is not true""."
BG_031	28	Eventually, with the help of the MRF, the ruling party pushed through the request that the session be closed because of the presence of classified information.
BG_031	29	"""In the beginning, the debate got a bit more political."
BG_031	30	"Eventually, on the 20th minute, things fell into place. 90% of the colleagues in the commission are former military"", Karakachanov explained."
BG_031	31	"The behaviour of the MRF is key because it depends on the movement whether the proposal will pass in plenary after the BSP described it as ""the bottom of the rule of law""."
BG_031	32	It was not supported by the leader of the National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria (NFSB) Valeri Simeonov, and resistance is expected from the pro-Russian Ataka.
BG_031	33	"The MPs of Veselin Mareshki from ""Volya"", who is in personal conflict with Military Minister Krasimir Karakachanov, cannot be counted on either."
BG_036	1	A three-member panel of the SAC upheld the decision of the CPC on the construction of the national children's hospital
BG_036	2	A three-member panel of the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) rejected the appeal of the Bulgarian Chamber of Architects (CAB) and upheld the decision of the Commission for Protection of Competition, which confirmed the decision of the Minister of Health to open a public procurement procedure with the subject.
BG_036	3	This was announced by the press center of the Supreme Administrative Court .The decision in administrative case 12024 of 2019 of the SAC is final.
BG_036	4	The three-judge panel considers that the CPC's decision is correct and that no irregularities have been committed in its adoption which would lead to its annulment.
BG_036	5	The tender documentation approved by the contracting authority shall contain the minimum necessary data for the preparation by the potential tenderers of a concept for the implementation of the activities under the subject of the contract.
BG_036	6	In this concept, the participants should describe and justify their vision for the implementation of the design in all phases and parts of the investment project, including stages, workflow and sequence of execution, time reconciliation of activities (including time schedule) subject to the design, outlining the organizational structure and management of human resources, the way of implementation of the task, taking into account: interrelationship between the different parts of the investment project, so that the final product is presented.
BG_036	7	In view of the volume and complexity of the subject of the contract, the contracting authority has provided for a conceptual design or concept to be submitted at the bidding stage and for the preparation of the investment project with all its phases to be carried out by the appointed contractor.
BG_036	8	At the stage of participation in the procedure it is required to demonstrate the necessary team, which has the competence and experience to perform the activities under the subject of the contract.
BG_036	9	The Supreme Court judges did not accept the claims and arguments of the CAB that the lack of division of the contract into separate positions - a separate position for the design and a separate position for the construction, restricts competition and does not allow the designers to participate independently in the procedure.
BG_036	10	The division of the contract into lots is a matter of expediency and is not subject to judicial review.
BG_036	11	The three-member panel considers that the overall organisation of the work process and the quality of the execution of the contract require that the design, construction and supervision activities be carried out by a single contractor.
BG_036	12	In case more than one contractor is involved in the allocation of individual positions, this would lead to the need for a complex process of coordination on the part of the Contracting Authority and the mobilization of a large number of resources, which would lead to difficulties and the risk of untimely and poor performance of the contract.
BG_036	13	On the other hand, the specificity of the subject of the contract implies uniform solutions that can only be achieved by the joint execution of all the activities of the procurement.
BG_036	14	The quality and timeliness of the execution are also sought by the contracting authority, given the object to be built, namely the National Multiprofile Children's Hospital.
BG_036	15	In February 2019, the developer carried out a survey of the structure, concluding that the structure could be completed following remedial works.
BG_036	16	According to the recommendations of the structural expertise, it is planned to restore the integrity of the cross-section of the reinforced concrete elements and to reinforce the floor structures and reinforced concrete washers.
BG_036	17	After identification of the defects in the structure, based on the data from the survey, the contractor is to propose to the client a structural solution regarding the measures to be applied to the building structure to bring it into compliance with the requirements of the current regulations, the prepared structural expertise and quantity accounts.
BG_039	1	Dimitar Branchkov, Mayor of Petrich: It is extremely important to comment on the...
BG_039	2	The project for the reconstruction of the Kulata BCP does not include the widening of the road before the checkpoint.
BG_039	3	"This was said by the Director of the General Directorate of Border Police, Chief Commissioner Svetlan Kichikov in Petrich, after a meeting of the Committee on Public Order and Security of the National Assembly, reported a reporter of Radio ""Focus"" - Pirin."
BG_039	4	Chief Commissioner Svetlan Kichikov explained that the road, which the Municipality of Petrich insists on widening, is outside the border control area.
BG_039	5	"""We need other government entities to figure out that lane there."
BG_039	6	We have already spoken to the Mayor of Petrich about this, but they need to make other contacts.
BG_039	7	"The Border Police is not the institution that should ""unblock"" this second lane"", said Chief Commissioner Kichikov."
BG_039	8	The Director of the General Directorate of Border Police stressed that after the reconstruction of the Kulata BCP the routes will almost double.
BG_039	9	"""We are now acting in only one direction, split in two."
BG_039	10	That is, we have four routes per output and four per input.
BG_039	11	After the end of the activities that are being carried out, we will have eight routes only per exit.
BG_039	12	This will almost double the capacity of the point.
BG_039	13	"When we have the opportunity with more traffic, with movable barriers, we can run another route to take into account the current situation,"" said Chief Commissioner Kichikov."
BG_039	14	Once the widening of the Kulata BCP is done and joint checks start to be carried out on our territory, the connectivity infrastructure may need to be improved.
BG_039	15	"This was said by the Minister of Interior Mladen Marinov in Petrich, after a meeting of the Committee on Public Order and Security of the National Assembly, reported a reporter of Radio ""Focus"" - Pirin."
BG_039	16	In the words of Minister Marinov, currently the problem at the checkpoint is not the connecting bridge, but the few routes where cars and trucks are processed.
BG_039	17	"""The idea of the reconstruction of the checkpoint is first of all to separate the flows of motor vehicles - trucks on one side and cars on the other, so that they do not mix."
BG_039	18	"This year we made such organization in the summer and it gave good results,"" Marinov said."
BG_039	19	The Interior Minister added that there is always the subjective factor.
BG_039	20	"""On the one hand is the organisation of work, on the other is the performance of the individual's tasks."
BG_039	21	And when the two things are not good you end up with bad results.
BG_039	22	When we make a good organisation, we can also see which employees are not fulfilling their duties and specific disciplinary measures are taken.
BG_039	23	"This is a two-way process"", Minister Marinov stressed."
BG_039	24	At 14.30 the Committee on Internal Security and Public Order will hold an external meeting in the Municipality of Petrich.
BG_039	25	This was announced by the Police Department - Blagoevgrad.
BG_039	26	Invited are representatives of the political and professional leadership of the Ministry of Interior and representatives of the local government.
BG_039	27	The Kulata BCP will be visited and the measures taken to counteract migration pressure, prevent violations and improve the traffic flow through the border crossing points will be reported.
BG_044	1	Celebrating 10 years of the Eastern Partnership Initiative
BG_044	2	We celebrate 10 years since the launch of the Eastern Partnership initiative.
BG_044	3	"On this occasion, the conference ""Caucasian Captives: the EU's Eastern Partnership - a policy of inclusion or a tool for containment?"
BG_044	4	"""."
BG_044	5	The forum was organised by the Delegation of Bulgarian Socialists to the European Parliament and the Institute for Economics and International Relations.
BG_044	6	According to Vice President Iliana Iotova, at the tenth year of the initiative, the results are not satisfactory.
BG_044	7	In her words, the balance sheet shows too much ambition but too little results.
BG_044	8	Yotova pointed out that the European Union had failed to fill the initiative with the necessary content.
BG_044	9	The Vice President said that the Eastern Partnership aims to strengthen the political association and economic integration of six Eastern European and South Caucasus countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine.
BG_044	10	In her words, the Eastern Partnership is conspicuously absent from the European Union's priorities.
BG_044	11	She added that in her speech to the European Parliament a few days ago the new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen did not even mention it when talking about the Union's foreign policy, and the general and wishful formulations from the first declaration in 2009 continue to this day.
BG_044	12	Iliana Iotova made a brief assessment of the achievements in the partnership between the European Union and these six countries.
BG_044	13	According to her, the balance sheet includes visa liberalisation and visa waiver for several countries; cooperation networks whose results are not yet in the visible sphere; some growth of European investments; association agreements with Ukraine, Georgia Moldova.
BG_044	14	The Vice President pointed out the main reasons for the lack of real implementation of the Eastern Partnership.
BG_044	15	According to her, the first one is that Moscow is convinced that the initiative has as its main goal a rupture of ties between Russia and the participating countries.
BG_044	16	"""On the other hand, within the European Union itself, we seem to have failed to engage all 28 member states in carefully developing our common policy towards the East and in its methodical implementation"", Iliana Iotova noted."
BG_044	17	According to the vice-president, in the Eastern Partnership countries there are created over-expectations, the biggest of which is that full membership is at hand.
BG_044	18	Yotova also said that hardly anything could discredit the European idea more than false hopes.
BG_044	19	According to the vice-president, the prospects for successful development of the Eastern Partnership have been further undermined by the transformation of the initiative into a counterpoint to another no less important direction of European foreign policy - the Mediterranean.
BG_044	20	"Yotova said that the ""Eastern Partnership"" has put the EU's relations with a large part of the former Soviet republics in brackets and inside the brackets the relations with Russia have remained."
BG_044	21	In her words, the big problem is that in a similar way Russia brackets out its relations with us, the European Union and Moscow's bilateral relations with the member states, while inside the brackets remain the relations with the former Soviet republics.
BG_044	22	She added that seen in this way, the equation on both the EU and Russian sides leads to the perception of the countries in the South Caucasus and Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova as a disputed rather than shared neighbourhood between the EU and Russia.
BG_044	23	According to Iliana Iotova, it is of key importance for the European Union to convince Russia that it does not want confrontation and it is in the interest of all that the South Caucasus be seen as a territory of shared neighbourhood.
BG_044	24	The Vice President pointed out that the initiative deserves to exist, but on the condition that we rethink in depth the foundations on which we are building our eastern neighbourhood policy and make the necessary changes.
BG_044	25	The Vice President called for a more active role of Bulgaria in the Eastern Partnership initiative.
BG_044	26	According to Iotova, Bulgaria's geographic position and its position in the EU arm Bulgarian politicians with ideas to participate in the discussions on the future of the initiative.
BG_044	27	"""I expect to finally hear a consolidated Bulgarian position on the issue, to see more public discussions,"" the Vice President said."
BG_044	28	She said that in no case should the Eastern Partnership and the European integration of the Western Balkans be opposed.
BG_045	1	The case against Ochite returned to the special prosecution
BG_045	2	The Specialized Criminal Court terminated the proceedings and returned the case against Dimitar Zhelyazkov - Mit'o Ochite to the Specialized Prosecutor's Office, which must eliminate the numerous procedural shortcomings and inconsistencies.
BG_045	3	This was announced by the President of the Trial Chamber at the end of the adjournment hearing, which lasted more than 9 hours.
BG_045	4	The judge said they could be removed, but only in the pre-trial phase, BGNES reported.
BG_045	5	In the words of the magistrates, a significant violation was committed against Dimitar Zhelyazkov - Ochite in relation to the charges against him.
BG_045	6	"""He has been extradited to our country from Turkey with a European Arrest Warrant, which lists certain crimes for which he can be tried, namely leading an organised criminal group and three arsons."
BG_045	7	However, the indictment includes charges of drug distribution and extortion by threats, for which he cannot be tried at this time.
BG_045	8	"That is why the specialised prosecutor's office must ask permission from our neighbour,"" the president of the panel said."
BG_045	9	There are also violations and deficiencies with regard to the other 12 people who have been held criminally responsible.
BG_045	10	According to the judge, there is no description of their functions in the organized criminal group, as well as no description of what their participation consists of.
BG_045	11	It is also unclear how the amount of the material damage was determined and what exactly it is.
BG_045	12	"""The court was absolutely right."
BG_045	13	He reiterated the arguments that we made during the meeting.
BG_045	14	The indictment will define the framework within which we will defend ourselves and it must be clear.
BG_045	15	Sorry, but it's good for prosecutors to read.
BG_045	16	After all, you saw four prosecutors.
BG_045	17	"Their capacity should be sufficient,"" Atty."
BG_045	18	Ivo Naydenov.
BG_045	19	He said the state prosecution would now protest the special court's decision.
BG_045	20	The measures of the detainees remained unchanged, as according to the judge there are no grounds to change them at this time.
BG_045	21	Dimitar Zhelyazkov is accused of leading an organized criminal group for extortion, coercion, threats, arson and drug distribution.
BG_045	22	Another 12 people were involved, including Zhelyazkov's daughter Stanislava.
BG_045	23	"She is accused of collecting the ""Peace"" fee from taxi companies and owners of commercial premises in Sunny Beach."
BG_045	24	She is currently out on bail.
BG_045	25	In addition to being the leader of an organised criminal group, Ochite will be held responsible for 9 acts committed by him and the other defendants on his personal orders.
BG_045	26	In some of the cases Zhelyazkov personally participated in the racketeering of his targeted victims.
BG_045	27	For the crimes he committed, the law provides for up to 15 years in prison, a fine of 5 to 10 thousand leva and confiscation of one half of his property.
BG_053	1	Because of 167 grape pickers in Lyon we are in the top 5 for human trafficking
BG_053	2	In our country, France, Belgium, Romania and Austria, the most cases are filed.
BG_053	3	Bulgarians, along with citizens of Romania, Hungary, France and the Netherlands, are among the most frequent victims of human trafficking in the EU.
BG_053	4	This is according to a report presented on Wednesday by the European Commission.
BG_053	5	Sexual exploitation continues to be the most common target.
BG_053	6	However, several countries have reported an increase in human trafficking for labour exploitation.
BG_053	7	In this context, the report mentions a specific case in which 167 Bulgarian citizens were identified as victims of trafficking.
BG_053	8	A Bulgarian-French investigative operation involving Europol and Eurojust in 2019 succeeded in dismantling a criminal group that exploited immigrants for grape harvesting near Lyon under extremely miserable conditions.
BG_053	9	Four members of the group were arrested - three from Bulgaria and one from France.
BG_053	10	In 2017 and 2018, 14 145 trafficking cases were detected at EU level, half of them involving EU nationals.
BG_053	11	Among the other victims in Europe, the most frequent are citizens of Nigeria, China, Ukraine, Morocco and India.
BG_053	12	The data show that trafficking for criminal purposes and forced begging are most common in Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, the Netherlands and Poland.
BG_053	13	The victims are usually poor or dependent minority people who are forced to steal, cheat or sell drugs.
BG_053	14	Bulgaria, along with France, Belgium, Romania and Austria, is among the countries in the EU with the highest number of cases of human trafficking. Europeans account for 70% of the indictments.
BG_053	15	About five per cent of the victims were forced into forced labour.
BG_053	16	More than two-thirds of the accused are men.
BG_053	17	It is reported that one in three cases of trafficking in the EU takes place within the same country.
BG_053	18	Most often (72%) the victims are women and girls.
BG_053	19	The wife of Pittsburgh hockey forward Evgeni Malkin, Anna Kasterova, made it to the Top 20 sexiest women in Russia.
BG_053	20	The ranking was prepared by the readers of the local edition of Maxim magazine.
BG_053	21	The beautiful lady, who is a sports presenter, takes the 17th place.
BG_053	22	First in the singer Ana Pletnyova.
BG_053	23	Rio Ferdinand's wife, Kate, was furious at the comment on social media.
BG_053	24	She was accused by a follower of lying about having a difficult pregnancy.
BG_053	25	This took the nerve out of the former Manchester United captain's wife, who put it nicely under comment.
BG_053	26	Kate is in an advanced pregnancy and she will soon bestow Ferdinand with a fourth child.
BG_059	1	Kristian Wigenin:
BG_059	2	If we don't approach Gazprom pragmatically, people will suffer, not the politicians who ideologize the issue
BG_059	3	Obviously, to date we do not have enough gas guaranteed to cover the country's needs for the rest of the year.
BG_059	4	The issue is key because if there is no gas, people will stay in the cold, some of them in the dark, they will close down or reduce their business, people will be out of work.
BG_059	5	"These will be the consequences if we do not guarantee the necessary quantities of natural gas."""
BG_059	6	"Since we see at the moment that we have no realistic alternative that would guarantee a secure alternative at an acceptable price, it is normal to say that we have to turn to Gazprom Export to fulfill their commitments, which they have under the contract with Bulgaria,"" he stressed."
BG_059	7	Vigenin pointed out that this is not about a new contract, but about the implementation of the current one by the end of the year.
BG_059	8	According to the socialist, the issue is being politicised too much, while the left calls for pragmatism.
BG_059	9	If we are not pragmatic, the people will suffer, not the political leaders who explain what drama will happen if Bulgaria imports Russian gas.
BG_059	10	"It is as if European countries with far fewer doubts about their Euro-Atlantic identity do not import Russian gas"", Kristian Vigenin commented."
BG_059	11	In his words, the first days of the caretaker government have given unnecessary indications that through the caretaker cabinet an attempt is being made to interfere the presidential institution in the internal affairs of the BSP and it is logical that these attacks start with the party leader.
BG_059	12	"I think we had a clear enough reaction and the people understood that party issues are the party's business, and at the moment the presidential institution, through the caretaker government, has far more important issues to address"", the BSP deputy chairman is adamant."
BG_059	13	Any caretaker government should refrain from more serious personnel changes.
BG_059	14	"This started with a lot of dismissals and appointments and one would have thought he was planning to stay for quite a long time"", Vigenin pointed out."
BG_059	15	He recalled that quite a few socialists had also been dismissed from public office.
BG_059	16	It's sad to see pictures of people who worked for Radev and Iotova in the campaign, there were even cases of chairmen of their local staffs, and the order to release them published next to them.
BG_059	17	Yes, it was happening.
BG_059	18	This wave seemed to subside after our reaction.
BG_059	19	"It is a pity that this was happening"", Kristian Vigenin commented, stressing that the Left's campaign will not be focused on this."
BG_059	20	"We will focus on the positive things, what we have done and what we plan to do after the elections"", the BSP deputy chairman said."
BG_059	21	Already in the previous months there were indications that migration to the EU would increase.
BG_059	22	This pressure is likely to continue to intensify.
BG_059	23	It seems to me that now is the time for the government to do a full review of what the problem is.
BG_059	24	"Since the time of the migrant crisis, we have established infrastructure and interaction with neighbouring countries, so everything we need is in place,"" Vigenin further said, stressing that there is no room for panic among the people."
BG_061	1	Domestic violence and drink-driving on the rise, prosecutors report
BG_061	2	In 2021, 55 364 pre-trial proceedings were monitored in the Sofia District Prosecutor's Office (SDP), or nearly 40 percent more than in 2020, when the number was 39 963, according to the annual report, the prosecutor's office said.
BG_061	3	The highest number of pre-trial proceedings were initiated for theft, followed by pre-trial proceedings for destruction and damage of property and fraud.
BG_061	4	There has been an increase in investigations, convictions and sanctions for citizens charged with drink and drug driving.
BG_061	5	In the past year, prosecutors at the SRP have filed 561 indictments for drunk and drugged driving, resulting in 527 convictions and sanctions.
BG_061	6	There was also an increase in crimes committed in the context of domestic violence - bodily harm, threat to kill and breach of a protection order.
BG_061	7	The total number of cases and pre-trial proceedings initiated for crimes committed in the context of domestic violence for the period from 01.01.2021 to 31.12.2021 in the SRP is 1731.
BG_061	8	For 2020 they were 1313.
BG_061	9	Most of them are solved.
BG_061	10	There is also an increase in the number of new pre-trial proceedings for crimes against the person in 2021 - 2139 cases, compared to 1940 proceedings in 2020, of which 336 acts against 373 persons have been submitted to the court.
BG_061	11	The largest number of new cases filed for these offenses were for aiding and/or abetting suicide.
BG_061	12	The next highest number of cases was intentional injuries - 665 cases in total, followed by criminal threats - 351.
BG_061	13	During the reporting period, a total of 2,624 drug trafficking and smuggling cases were monitored in the JIT, with the number of new cases being 2001.
BG_061	14	A total of 2,190 of the monitored cases were resolved by the prosecutor; 314 of them were submitted to the court.
BG_061	15	The number of persons convicted by a final judgment is 228.
BG_061	16	In 2021, prosecutors in the SRP worked on 51 cases of human trafficking offences.
BG_061	17	Of these, 22 proceedings have been resolved and four have been brought to court.
BG_061	18	The victims of the crimes described above were 82 persons, nine of whom were minors and four were juveniles.
BG_061	19	For the period from 01.01.2021 to 31.12.2021, there is an increase of 60.57 percent in the total number of pre-trial proceedings resolved by the prosecutor in 2021, namely - 43 350 pieces.
BG_061	20	The number of indictments filed in court in 2021 was 1,822, bringing 1,932 people to trial.
BG_061	21	During the reporting period, there were 2,239 more persons convicted and sanctioned, up from 1,967 in 2020.
BG_061	22	For 2021, the number of convicted individuals subject to a custodial sentence was 1,611 and represented nearly 60 percent of the total number of convicted and sanctioned individuals.
BG_062	1	The question is whether the constitutional unity on this topic will last
BG_062	2	In the first vote, the majority in the National Assembly adopted the amendments to the Judiciary Act.
BG_062	3	In the draft, apart from the abolition of the specialised justice system, one corruption tool that is familiar to the Bulgarian reality is abolished - that of the so-called career bonuses.
BG_062	4	What do they consist in?
BG_062	5	Most understandably - in the privileged treatment of the senior administration in the judiciary, namely the members of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the inspectors in the Inspectorate of the SJC.
BG_062	6	Under the current text, a member of the SJC, whether he was a judge, prosecutor or investigator before his election to the Judicial Council, has the possibility after leaving the SJC to return to a position one grade higher than the one held before the election.
BG_062	7	De facto, if he worked at the district level - to go to the circuit level, if he was at the county level - to the appellate level, etc.
BG_062	8	In addition to a career boost, without having to appear in a competition, the members of the SJC and the Inspectorate received, if they wished, a financial bonus in the form of a monetary compensation.
BG_062	9	So perversely legitimate for many years, parties known to us bought influence in the judiciary with the public's money, transforming it for a select few into good post and caviar for good digestion.
BG_062	10	How did it come to this?
BG_062	11	With slow and confident steps over the years, as before we have had occasions to celebrate.
BG_062	12	The original intention of the Judiciary Act of 2007 was that after the expiry of the term of office of the members of the SJC they should return to work where they came from.
BG_062	13	You were a district judge or prosecutor in Gabrovo - you go there again.
BG_062	14	With the appearance of GERB on the parliamentary scene in 2011, the law was changed ambiguously - after the expiry of the term of office of the members of the SJC, they return to work in the court or the prosecutor's office in a position no lower than the one held before the election.
BG_062	15	And this now gives the opportunity, if you have been exemplary and obedient in decision-making (the election of Vladimira Yaneva as head of Sofia City Court in 2012 is a test of this), to go from the district court in Gabrovo to the court in Varna, for example.
BG_062	16	The law looks like it's keeping you from being demoted, but it's actually a form of encouragement.
BG_062	17	In 2016, things are almost falling into place, the law is back to its 2007 conception of where it came from and where it went.
BG_062	18	"But in 2017 the election of the president of the Supreme Administrative Court is due and the then majority (GERB-Patriots) again strengthened"" judicial independence by adopting again the bonus-vote system in the constitutional judicial law."
BG_062	19	Thus, the members of the SJC, whose term of office expires shortly after their election, get the opportunity to return to the position they held before the election or to a position of equal rank (equal rank - from the district level in Varna - to the district level in whichever city you like).
BG_062	20	In this way, those with an equal grade can remain in Sofia in comfortable positions in the less busy courts.
BG_062	21	And the right candidate was unsurprisingly elected as the President of the SAC.
BG_062	22	And here it is 2019, the election of Geshev as prosecutor general is just around the corner.
BG_062	23	History repeats itself - the familiar majority takes the legislative initiative into its own hands.
BG_062	24	Their views go as far as saying that the members of the Judicial Council, after the expiry of their term, should be appointed to the position they held before the election, to a position of equal rank or to a position one rank higher.
BG_062	25	Thus, those obedient to the party headquarters without objective assessment of professional and moral qualities take one step higher, and those who defended principles and judicial independence are left with the positions before the election.
BG_062	26	Two revisions of this text followed in 2020 which maintained this situation.
BG_062	27	The first one - adopted without a parliamentary debate - was proposed by the MRF, with the support of GERB-Patriots.
BG_062	28	The second modified the text but kept the meaning.
BG_062	29	This text was attacked before the Constitutional Court by the Supreme Court of Cassation with a request for a declaration of unconstitutionality.
BG_062	30	Thus, the provision was declared unconstitutional as to equal rank, thereby denying undue migration to courts and prosecutor's offices at one level but in cities of choice.
BG_062	31	However, the option of one grade higher than the post held prior to the election remained in force.
BG_062	32	Let's see if the coalition unity of the PP, BSP, ITN and DB on these issues will last till the end and will lead to an effective repeal of this compromised instrument of influence.
BG_065	1	They raise the price of the pension by BGN 10, the month will now be sold for BGN 120.78.
BG_065	2	Payment is made by bank transfer, then the insurance institute gives a certificate.
BG_065	3	Over 11% of new retirees opted for an early but reduced pension.
BG_065	4	The National Social Security Institute raises the price for buying insufficient pensionable service by BGN 9.90.
BG_065	5	Thus, in 2020 for each month of insufficient seniority will have to be paid 120.78 BGN.
BG_065	6	The reason for the increase in the cost of the internship is that from the beginning of 2020 the minimum social security income of the self-insured will be 610 BGN.
BG_065	7	According to the Social Security Code, it is on this that the cost of insufficient pensionable service is calculated.
BG_065	8	The amount of the pension contribution remains unchanged - 19.8% of the minimum social security income of the self-employed.
BG_065	9	Thus. from. 1. January. one. year. of. service. now. costs. BGN. 1,449.36. and. the. full. 5. years. will. come. out. 7246,8 BGN.
BG_065	10	Buying work experience is becoming an increasingly used option by pension claimants.
BG_065	11	"The reason is that more and more people in pre-retirement age have so-called missing years in their careers when they were unemployed, experts from the National Social Security Institute told ""24 hours""."
BG_065	12	At the same time, the increase in the length of service requirement as part of the 2015 pension reform continues.
BG_065	13	The aim is for both men and women to start retiring after 40 years of pensionable service.
BG_065	14	On average, people are about 20 months short of their seniority, and over 5,000 people buy months short each year.
BG_065	15	Last year, one month cost 110.88 BGN.
BG_065	16	More and more people are not waiting to meet the conditions for retirement either, but choosing to receive a reduced pension in exchange for retiring a year early.
BG_065	17	This option was chosen by 4202 people and the average age of under-achievement was 9.6 months.
BG_065	18	In the same period from January to September 2019, 37 034 new personal retirement pensions were granted.
BG_065	19	This means that over 11% of new pensioners in the first 9 months of 2019 opted for an early but reduced pension from the National Insurance Institute.
BG_065	20	Every. Bulgarian. citizen. has. the. right. to. buy. up. to. 5. years. of. service. for. retirement,. even. if. he. is. not. going. to. claim. it. from. the. social. security. institute. soon.
BG_065	21	According to the law, the time spent studying at university or for a PhD counts as social security service, but graduates must pay for each month of their studies.
BG_065	22	People who have reached the age for the third category pension are also entitled to purchase the missing service.
BG_065	23	However, under this option too, no more than 5 years of service can be paid.
BG_065	24	The payment of the service is made by bank transfer, but a retirement certificate must also be issued by a branch of the National Social Insurance Institution for the transaction to be recognised at the time the pension is granted.
BG_065	25	Graduates can only buy an apprenticeship for the period of study that is listed in the curriculum.
BG_065	26	It does not matter whether they studied full-time, part-time or evening.
BG_065	27	It is important that they have not worked during this time and, for women, have not taken maternity leave.
BG_065	28	They must also present a diploma of higher or post-secondary education and a document certifying the duration of studies, or a document certifying that they have obtained a doctorate or doctorate degree.
BG_065	29	People who have reached the age for the third category pension can also buy a seniority.
BG_065	30	In 2020, women will retire at 61 years and 6 months and the length of service should be 35 years and 10 months.
BG_065	31	For men, the age of 64 years and 3 months and the length of service of 38 years and 10 months are required.
BG_065	32	If it is not enough, they also have to apply to the NSSI to have their seniority sold.
BG_065	33	And the employees of the insurance institute assess exactly how much time is missing and give information on the exact amount of contributions due and the procedure for their payment.
BG_065	34	"""The time for which contributions have been paid for a period longer than that required for entitlement to a personal pension shall not be counted as length of service."
BG_065	35	"During this time, the person may request reimbursement of the amounts unduly paid for social security contributions from the relevant territorial directorate of the National Revenue Agency,"" the NSSI reminds."
BG_065	36	That is. it is pointless. to buy. more service than. the. missing. months, it will not result in a higher pension amount, as regular additional months of service would do.
BG_065	37	"The certificate of ""purchased insufficient seniority"" is issued by the territorial division of the National Social Insurance Institution on the basis of the document for the paid social insurance contributions."
BG_065	38	"However, the pensionable earnings for the period for which the pensionable service has been ""purchased"" shall not be taken into account in calculating the individual coefficient of the pensioner."
BG_065	39	That is, the accumulated service serves to acquire the right to a pension, but cannot increase its amount.
BG_095	1	Up to 200 000 BGN scholarship for 24 top universities in the world paid by the state
BG_095	2	(Review)
BG_095	3	The condition is that when they graduate, they return to work in Bulgaria for at least three years.
BG_095	4	The state will give up to 200 000 BGN per year to Bulgarian students for master's studies in the most prestigious 24 universities in the world.
BG_095	5	The condition is that after graduation they return to work in Bulgaria.
BG_095	6	"This is what the draft of the National Programme ""Stefan Stambolov Fund"", which was published for public discussion, envisages."
BG_095	7	The aim of the Stefan Stambolov Fund is to provide Bulgarians with proven potential with access to education in leading foreign institutions of higher education.
BG_095	8	They will acquire skills related to the professions of the present and the future and apply their experience in Bulgaria.
BG_095	9	"""The knowledge, skills and competences acquired during their studies abroad, as well as their broadened outlook, can contribute to the development of the Bulgarian economy and society as a whole,"" the Ministry of Education and Science explained."
BG_095	10	Each year 2 million BGN will be allocated for scholarships, and so far it is planned that the Stefan Stambolov Fund will operate for at least three years.
BG_095	11	The first funding for Master's degrees at top universities abroad will be granted from the academic year 2022/2023, funding 10 students per year.
BG_095	12	Before they leave, they will sign a contract with the Bulgarian state.
BG_095	13	It will oblige them to return to the country within six months of graduation and work here on a work or civil contract for at least three years.
BG_095	14	If they do not, they will have to repay the grant with interest.
BG_095	15	The scholarships will. cover transportation to the foreign university, tuition fees, rent, medical insurance during the studies.
BG_095	16	Applicants must be Bulgarian citizens, have completed a Bachelor's or Master's degree, obtained no later than five years prior to the scholarship in a professional field corresponding to the desired Master's programme.
BG_095	17	They also need to have at least a Very Good 5 on their degree and at least a B2 level in the language to be studied.
BG_095	18	Priority will be given to applicants who have not previously studied abroad and have professional experience in their chosen field of study.
BG_095	19	The scholarships for the upcoming academic year will be awarded for master's degrees at universities in the top 15 of the four leading global university rankings current at the time of program development: the CWUR, QS World University Rankings, Shanghai Ranking's (The Academic Ranking of World Universities - ARWU) and The Times Higher Education World University Rankings.
BG_095	20	Selection is expected to start in June.
BG_095	21	The three stages will include a document review, a video interview and an individual interview.
BG_097	1	"Here is the move of ""The Change"" to keep Ninova happy"
BG_097	2	"At the coalition council tonight, ""We Continue the Change"" will correct its proposal on Ukraine by adding the wording ""military-technical"" assistance."
BG_097	3	"This is what Kaloyan Ikonomov, deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of ""We Continue the Change"", told BNT."
BG_097	4	"The draft decision of the largest parliamentary party, which was approved by the Foreign Affairs Committee, envisaged the National Assembly to give a mandate to the government to provide ""technical assistance for defensive purposes"" to Ukraine."
BG_097	5	The coalition partners are meeting tonight at a council where they will make another attempt to reach a consensus on providing military aid to Kiev before tomorrow the parliament considers the issue at an extraordinary session.
BG_097	6	This was originally due to take place on Sunday evening but was postponed until today.
BG_097	7	"""We understand what the arguments of the partners in the coalition are."
BG_097	8	The BSP understands the need to have a stable government in order to lead the country through the crises we are facing.
BG_097	9	Look, aid from Bulgaria to Ukraine will not tip the scales one way or the other.
BG_097	10	That is why in the conversation with Zelensky the prime minister said what we can do to help, the chairman of the PP parliamentary group Andrei Gyurov told Nova news. - We should not condescend.
BG_097	11	The BSP understands what the position is and I believe that they will behave responsibly to lead the country through the crises.
BG_097	12	"We are set to make responsible statesmanship decisions at the council tonight."""
BG_097	13	"""Ideally, all parties in the coalition will unite around the draft decision."
BG_097	14	It is clear that such an important issue cannot pass only with the sanction of part of the coalition or the National Assembly.
BG_097	15	But it is important to know that the parliament does not give arms to anyone, but a mandate to the Council of Ministers to decide what to do.
BG_097	16	That's why we went to Kiev, to see exactly what Zelensky needs.
BG_097	17	"This is a civilisational choice and how the National Assembly will react is a decision of each MP"", Economov said."
BG_097	18	The PP MP believes that the BSP will not leave the coalition because of the decision on military aid.
BG_097	19	"""This coalition has been demolished by the opposition ever since we created it."
BG_097	20	It's a bit like a long divorce between a man and a woman, where they've been divorced for 10 years and they're still together.
BG_097	21	Communication improves between partners and we now know each other's red lines much better.
BG_097	22	"So I don't think that Ms Ninova will leave the coalition because there are many more things that connect us than divide us"", he assured."
BG_097	23	"Commenting on President Rumen Radev's criticism, Kaloyan Ikonomov pointed out that ""We Continue the Change"" is not looking for a conflict with the institutions and will be happy to discuss the issue with the head of state's administration."
BG_097	24	"""It is important for society to unite on such issues."
BG_097	25	This is happening very close to us and we need to approach it responsibly.
BG_097	26	You cannot put an equal sign between military aid and war - they are completely different things.
BG_097	27	"In this case, we are helping a country under attack to defend itself"", Economov said."
BG_097	28	He added that on the issue of military aid there is polarisation in society, but it is due to misinformation.
BG_097	29	"""There is a very strong focus on the issue of ""fear"" and certain political circles, and not only such, are trying to instil a sense of fear in the society - that if we give weapons, you see - we are entering the war."
BG_097	30	And it's a double choice - we have good and bad very clearly articulated.
BG_097	31	Because what are the guarantees that Russia will not attack someone else tomorrow and this war will not escalate?
BG_097	32	"It is best for us that the war ends as soon as possible"", concluded Kaloyan Ikonomov, dir.bg reports."
BG_106	1	Why does the working Peevski annoy Prokopiev?
BG_106	2	The urban right is trying to sew the energy and the media to the MP from the MRF.
BG_106	3	It has become a habit to look for the shadow of MP Delyan Peevski with every new addition to the state.
BG_106	4	Whether it is energy, infrastructure or media.
BG_106	5	"After the judicial mockery of ""Telegraf Media"", the favourite comment that Peevski pulls the strings of the magistrates fell."
BG_106	6	And now, the army of sites around the Capital circle has found new gum.
BG_106	7	First, he sewed the new head of BNT Emil Koshlukov.
BG_106	8	Two weeks did not stop the black predictions of how the national television will become a machete against free speech.
BG_106	9	Once it became clear that there was no change in its editorial policy (even if it still sounds slightly oppositional), the hatred shifted to BEH.
BG_106	10	They said that the old new boss - Jacqueline Cohen, was also brought down by Peevski because he headed the holding under Oresharski.
BG_106	11	Should we expect a salvo against Temenuzhka Petkova very soon?
BG_106	12	Because when she fired Cohen and put in the urban right-wing-friendly leadership, the minister was getting adulation.
BG_106	13	Now, however, breaking their hacker, he certainly enters the list of Prokopie's targets.
BG_106	14	For two days the new member of the CEM - Galina Georgieva - has been at gunpoint.
BG_106	15	The attack was launched by Socialist MP Alexander Simov, who accused her of being Peevski's man and announced that through her the MP from MRF was taking over the CEM.
BG_106	16	Immediately all the nuts and bolts of the urban right's manipulation machine were put into rotation.
BG_106	17	Never mind that Simov's claim was refuted the second by the proposer of her nomination - the head of the cultural committee Vejdi Rashidov.
BG_106	18	The feeling of tendentiousness towards Georgieva remained, because only a year ago these same websites hardly reacted when the president appointed to the CEM the producer of a show in which his chief of staff Ivo Hristov was a co-host - Ivelina Dimitrova.
BG_106	19	Today Georgieva has no conflict of interest, so the cannonade of writings against her came down to the low grade in her diploma in agricultural economics.
BG_106	20	This was a sure proof that he did not have the necessary experience in media regulation.
BG_106	21	"The author of the piece in ""Dnevnik"", however, contradicted himself, listing economics among the areas from which the members of the council can be nominated."
BG_106	22	As well as quite a few appointments in a whole series of companies related to media and electronic communications.
BG_106	23	For Prokopiev's media machine, however, such controversies are a small stone that cannot derail them on their way to the ultimate goal - to throw mud at Peevski and thus drown his name in the swamp of fake news flooding the internet.
BG_106	24	Strange why, however, Prokopiev's spotlights are directed only at Georgieva's student book, but not at that of the scandalous investigator Boyko Atanasov, whom a few days ago their friends from the NGO BOETS nominated as a candidate for prosecutor general.
BG_106	25	"The legal website ""Legal World"" has already revealed the disturbing fact that Atanasov has barely tied a three in Criminal Law."
BG_106	26	The July attack of Prokopiev's media against Peevski is not at all accidental.
BG_106	27	Before the elections, they booed him for not going to parliament.
BG_106	28	And he was presented as a mythical figure pulling the strings of his Dubai palace.
BG_106	29	The MP from MRF, however, showed everyone that he is an active participant in the political process.
BG_106	30	He toured the country before the vote and then came up with legislative initiatives to change taxes and free daycare.
BG_106	31	He also participated in the consultations on the reduction of party subsidies.
BG_106	32	The working Peevski is not to the taste of the urban right.
BG_106	33	Because his proposals do not get rid of her.
BG_106	34	They are for the people, not for the oligarchs.

BG_113	2	Food and medicine shopping initiative for the elderly aims to keep them alive and healthy in the face of the pandemic
BG_113	3	The Director of the Directorate of Public Order and Security at Sofia Municipality Krasimir Dimitrov in an interview with Focus Agency about the restoration of the aid for shopping for food and medicine for the elderly
BG_113	4	Focus:
BG_113	5	As of October 27, the food and medicine shopping assistance for the elderly was restored.
BG_113	6	What is the idea of this initiative?
BG_113	7	Krasimir Dimitrov: The initiative is of Sofia Mayor Yordanka Fandakova.
BG_113	8	The aim is to help the elderly, those with chronic illnesses or those who have difficulty moving, who are at risk of infection when waiting in queues in shops and pharmacies.
BG_113	9	Also people who have no relatives or acquaintances to help them.
BG_113	10	By calling 02 9041397 they can submit a list of basic essentials for us to purchase for them.
BG_113	11	Naturally the cost of the products is paid, nothing else.
BG_113	12	We can also buy medicines with the prescription booklet.
BG_113	13	There are pharmacies in larger grocery chains that we have agreed with to serve us with priority.
BG_113	14	The important thing is to preserve the lives and health of the elderly and the hardly mobile in Sofia.
BG_113	15	Focus: How long will it last?
BG_113	16	Krassimir Dimitrov: As long as there are signals, we will continue this initiative.
BG_113	17	We have an organization to attract volunteers from the volunteer unit of Sofia Municipality and volunteers from the Bulgarian Red Cross.
BG_113	18	Focus: How many people is the team?
BG_113	19	Krassimir Dimitrov: From 09.00 to 18.30 we have a person who is on the phone and receives and processes the signals.
BG_113	20	We have about five teams.
BG_113	21	As of the first of November, most of our directorate is switching to regular shifts so we can serve more people.
BG_113	22	Focus: What measures have you taken to protect the team and seniors?
BG_113	23	Krasimir Dimitrov: The team itself is constantly being tested.
BG_113	24	We have a strict discipline about wearing masks.
BG_113	25	With suits and helmets, we treat hospital facilities and district administrations where there are employees with COVID.
BG_113	26	We comply with all requirements.
BG_113	27	I am also the chairman of the logistics headquarters at the regional headquarters in Sofia, so we have a reserve of masks and suits to be able to support the municipal hospitals.
BG_113	28	Focus: Before the initiative was discontinued for the summer months, how many people did you help?
BG_113	29	Krassimir Dimitrov: We have helped about 550 people on different campaigns.
BG_113	30	We helped about 1,778 families with food.
BG_113	31	The total number in one month was about 3,000 people we covered with free food and products.
BG_113	32	This was during the period when different areas in Sofia were quarantined and the cities blockaded.
BG_113	33	Focus: Do you think that more such initiatives for the elderly and people with disabilities will emerge given the serious epidemiological situation?
BG_113	34	Krassimir Dimitrov: By order of the Mayor, our Directorate of COVID activities has been working since March 8.
BG_113	35	One of them was the distribution of food by the Bulgarian Red Cross to people who are under quarantine.
BG_113	36	We also shopped for the elderly - handing out food aid.
BG_113	37	I think the Mayor's initiatives will continue to ensure that fewer seniors, people with disabilities and chronic illnesses become infected.

BG_121	21	An offer came to come to Bulgaria.

BG_123	2	Colonies of German antivaxxers are sprouting on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast
BG_123	3	"Germans, who are against the anti-pandemic measures and vaccines, are fleeing to Bulgaria in large numbers - this is the impression the reader has of the extensive article in the latest issue of the German magazine ""Spiegel""."
BG_123	4	Aheloy - a bastion of German antivaxxers?
BG_123	5	The article also gives examples which, however, should be interpreted with caution.
BG_123	6	"In the introduction to the article we read, ""German anti-vaxxers have found refuge in holiday colonies near the Black Sea: life there is cheap and anti-epidemic measures are looked down upon."""
BG_123	7	"The journalist visited their ""bastion"" in Aheloy - a residential complex named ""Chateau Aheloy"", in front of which numerous cars with German registration were parked."
BG_123	8	"The manager of the complex, Dirk Gelbrecht, is the founder of a group on the social network ""Telegram"", which is called ""German expatriates in Bulgaria"" and now unites 2,500 people, we learn from the article."
BG_123	9	Gelbrecht explains to the Spiegel journalist that around 60 people live in Chateau Aheloy - co-operators from several generations.
BG_123	10	In the aforementioned group on Telegram, Gelbrecht gives one of his motives to turn his back on Germany.
BG_123	11	"According to him, the media system in this country was ""false and hypocritical"" and had to be ""destroyed""."
BG_123	12	"The author of ""Spiegel"" notes that, without attracting much attention, the German anti-vaxxers are grouping in ""Telegram"" and heading towards Bulgaria - the ""slum of the EU""."
BG_123	13	German expats buy or rent real estate there, with a preference for the Black Sea coast - between Burgas and Varna.
BG_123	14	At Chateau Aheloy, the rent for an apartment is just 232 euros a month, and the German community already has its own newly established traditions.
BG_123	15	For example, every Tuesday he would gather for a brunch at the Hotel Provence and fill his time with fake news from his homeland - for example, that the autobahns were going to be closed at any moment so that people could not travel between different provinces.
BG_123	16	"The Germans, who do not believe in the pandemic and vaccines, are glad that the majority of Bulgarians also ""refreshingly"" share this distrust."
BG_123	17	The country is sparsely populated and the authorities are rather lazy, so you can easily go unnoticed here, says the German Urzulina.
BG_123	18	Life with the coronavirus in Bulgaria is meek, in restaurants the anti-epidemic measures are viewed through fingers, and in German emigrants this gives the feeling that they have regained a little freedom, we read in the article.
BG_123	19	"Urzulina puts it this way, ""Distance - zero."
BG_123	20	"""This is a sign of irresponsibility"" At the same time, however, Bulgaria is the record holder for coronavirus deaths in the whole of Europe, and vaccination rates are still extremely low, writes Walter Mayr in Spiegel."
BG_123	21	The author has also spoken with the Burgas doctor Svetoslav Todorov, who shows absolutely no understanding of the Germans' behaviour: 'It is almost criminal, because it is a manifestation of irresponsibility not only to oneself, but also to others', says the doctor.
BG_123	22	Later in the article, it also talks about the consultancy work practiced by a German former theology student.
BG_123	23	"For 2,499 euros he offers would-be immigrants a package of tips for a successful start in Bulgaria as a ""tax-advantaged destination"", where one can easily get a chic villa and drive his Porsche."
BG_123	24	"At the end of the long report, the journalist from ""Spiegel"" takes the readers to another bastion of the German immigrants and anti-vaxxers near Varna."
BG_123	25	"The main actor of the German diaspora in Varna was the Bulgarian Turkish woman Leni, who worked as a teacher in Potsdam for many years and today was ""the guiding star of all those who wanted to settle in Bulgaria""."
BG_123	26	"Lenny thinks that many people in Germany are ""brainwashed"" because they believe the media too much."
BG_123	27	In the compound near Varna she takes care of the children of the immigrants: she takes them to the beach and teaches them reading, writing, arithmetic, knitting and baking.

BG_149	1	MRF sounds alarm over OSCE election violations
BG_149	2	The movement raised the issue of openly unconstitutional texts in the Electoral Code
BG_149	3	Openly unconstitutional texts in the Electoral Code, disregard for the rights of voters, violations of the law by ministers who campaign without being on leave.
BG_149	4	These were some of the problems that the deputy chairmen of the MRF Yordan Tsonev and Khalil Letifov and Hamid Hamid - deputy chairman of the MRF discussed with representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
BG_149	5	During the meeting the problems in the electoral legislation and the conditions in which the election campaign for the 2021 general elections is taking place were discussed.
BG_149	6	First of all, Hamid Hamid raised legislative problems in the electoral legislation, expressing his concerns about the existence of openly unconstitutional texts in the Electoral Code.
BG_149	7	There are texts that either deprive Bulgarian citizens of the right to vote or those that make it impossible for Bulgarian citizens to vote, as well as other texts that violate a number of European principles and conventions, including the European Convention on Human Rights.
BG_149	8	Hamid Hamid noted that despite the efforts of the MRF, the ban on campaigning in a language other than Bulgarian still exists.
BG_149	9	Second was the reduced number of polling stations in non-EU countries, which limits the right to vote of Bulgarian citizens.
BG_149	10	Since 2009, the MRF has expressed its position on machine voting in order to reduce the subjective factor in the polling station committees.
BG_149	11	According to Hamid Hamid, mixed voting would lead to complete chaos.
BG_149	12	Yordan Tsonev, for his part, said that it is impressive that the election campaign of the ruling party is a violation of the laws of the country, since almost all ministers are candidates for MPs and are not on leave, some of them, for which they use state resources for the campaign.
BG_149	13	He was adamant that there was a real abuse of power during the campaign.
BG_149	14	Tsonev highlighted the fact that more than 67% of the precinct election protocols were wrong.
BG_149	15	"""There are gross violations in the polling station commissions for several reasons - first of all complicated election process, insufficient preparation and abuse of power,"" Tsonev emphasized."
BG_149	16	Khalil Letifov, Yordan Tsonev and Hamid Hamid also talked with representatives of the Limited Election Observation Mission (EOM).
BG_149	17	The mission is led by Corrine Jonker and consists of a team of 11 experts in Sofia and 12 long-term observers who will be deployed around the country from 10 March 2021.
BG_149	18	The mission will assess whether the elections are being conducted in accordance with the commitments to the OSCE, and whether they meet international standards for the conduct of democratic elections and the implementation of national legislation.
BG_157	1	Prevention or disgrace?
BG_157	2	The Ministry of Home Affairs has started testing its officers for alcohol and drugs after some of them were caught on the road with banned substances in their blood and managed to create embarrassing incidents.
BG_157	3	Prevention or disgrace is the action?
BG_157	4	Will we be more relaxed if we rely on sober, clear-headed police officers to protect us, or will we see every law enforcement officer as a potential inadequate intruder?
BG_157	5	The inspections of the Ministry of Interior are a complete downfall for the system, for the personnel potential, for the professionalism, for the individual, for the whole society.
BG_157	6	They show that trust has long been lost and the breakdown is widespread.
BG_157	7	The results of the inspections will probably give us chills and we will no longer be 80 or 90 but 100 percent convinced that we cannot rely on any institution for protection.
BG_157	8	Those who should be the regulators, the guardians, the controllers, are methodically losing the respect of those who pay their salaries and rely on them for security.
BG_157	9	The cops are now merging with those they have to fight.
BG_157	10	And we wonder who the criminals are and on which side of the dividing line they are.
BG_157	11	A boundary, even a conditional one, no longer exists because it has been crossed too often.
BG_157	12	The Ministry of Interior can do as many raids as it wants against violators on the road, drunk drivers, drug addicts behind the wheel.
BG_157	13	To declare war, to raise slogans, to stammer sympathetically and to look for a way out.
BG_157	14	But the tragedies will not decrease because the offenders have other offenders against them who cannot be an example and do not respect them.
BG_157	15	These problems are not of today.
BG_157	16	They have been accumulated for decades.
BG_157	17	They are related to the declining requirements in recruitment.
BG_157	18	On the other hand, there is also the question if the bar is raised, whether the number of candidates will decrease sharply and the units will become completely bare.
BG_157	19	The Ministry of Interior's leadership nicely brags that they will fire disciplinary offenders, but this also sounds more populist than realistic.
BG_157	20	Because again the question comes who will work on the road.
BG_157	21	"And if they double the salaries of the catadzis, we will still be asking ourselves ""And what do we do?"""
BG_157	22	every time we get caught in a violation.
BG_157	23	The process has two sides.
BG_157	24	Corruption annoys us a lot, but only when it is not about us.
BG_157	25	If so far we have been outraged by smoking law enforcement officers in sloppy postures and unprofessional behavior while performing their official duty, now it is time to be afraid of them.
BG_157	26	Because they become the new threat, but in uniform.
BG_157	27	"The alternative to the Interior Ministry's action looks more like the popular call, ""Let's not lurk, we'll get caught."""
BG_162	1	Expansion of the types of legal aid and the persons who benefit from it, proposes MoJ
BG_162	2	Expanding the range of persons eligible for legal aid, waiving court fees and providing legal aid in out-of-court proceedings.
BG_162	3	This is provided by the amendments and supplements to the Legal Aid Act, published for public consultation by the Ministry of Justice, according to its press centre.
BG_162	4	The proposed changes are one of the measures in the National Recovery and Sustainability Plan.
BG_162	5	The aim of the bill is to improve access to justice by providing more favourable conditions for people from vulnerable groups. - Ensure access to justice through legal aid in out-of-court proceedings and out-of-court dispute resolution procedures.
BG_162	6	The current law on legal aid restricts consultations and preparation of documents to those relating to court proceedings.
BG_162	7	The amendments enable citizens who are eligible for legal aid to receive advice and assistance from a lawyer in preparing documents for proceedings for the issuance of individual administrative acts and their administrative challenge, as well as representation before non-judicial bodies and in non-judicial procedures (for example, in mediation and arbitration).
BG_162	8	The use of these new legal options provides faster and cheaper remedies with less formalities, will prevent litigation in court, will reduce litigation and court cases
BG_162	9	.
BG_162	10	- Expanding the range of persons with a specific profile able to access the legal aid system.
BG_162	11	To the circle of persons with a specific profile having access to the legal aid system are added persons with physical and mental disabilities, as well as persons having received international protection or enjoying temporary protection. - Exemption from court fees and costs in civil and administrative proceedings, including reimbursement of legal aid costs to the National Legal Aid Bureau (NLAB).
BG_162	12	This will be done at the discretion of the court in cases where legal aid is admitted for social reasons established by documents from the relevant authorities and the inability of persons to pay for the defence of an authorised lawyer.
BG_162	13	The bill proposes that abuse of the right to legal aid should be grounds for its termination.
BG_162	14	Abuse will occur if, in the course of the same proceedings, the legal aid user has requested the replacement of a lawyer three or more times.
BG_162	15	Any other bad faith exercise of the right to legal aid carried out in contravention of the purpose of the law and the rights and legitimate interests of the parties to the proceedings shall also constitute abuse.
BG_162	16	The amendments also provide for an increase in the remuneration of the five members of the NBPB.
BG_162	17	The reasoning in this case is that this remuneration has not been changed since 1 January 2012, and since then there have been changes in the socio-economic conditions and situation in the country which unconditionally justify its change.
BG_162	18	Moreover, during these years, the commitments of the members of the Bureau in relation to the exercise of their statutory powers have increased.

BG_168	12	It highlighted concrete measures such as ERA4You to support young researchers and talent, the creation of a network of digital hubs and the Widening 2.0 strategy to reduce the gap and improve access to scientific excellence.
BG_168	13	Other examples are the Horizon Europe missions, in particular the Healthy Oceans, Seas, Coasts and Inland Waters mission.
BG_168	14	"""Our ambition is to restore Europe's ocean, marine and freshwater ecosystems by 2030."
BG_168	15	To achieve it, we also need to engage European citizens through education, training and culture.

BG_172	7	All data in it will be accessible electronically.
BG_172	8	Limited rights to use individual information will be given, without the possibility of changes by citizens.
BG_172	9	The conditions and procedure for publishing information in the single register and for keeping it up to date will be determined by a regulation of the Council of Ministers.
BG_172	10	Until it is established, the acts issued will be published according to the current procedure.
BG_172	11	The bill adopted by the government is drafted in implementation of the government's policy to facilitate administrative services.
BG_172	12	The purpose of the changes in the Land Use Planning Act is to provide quick access to the data and better administrative services by combining the data on spatial planning, investment design and construction.
BG_172	13	For this reason, it is foreseen that the administrative authorities, public service organisations, persons performing public functions and judicial authorities shall establish ex officio, for the purposes of the relevant proceedings, all the circumstances entered in the single register on the basis of the relevant identification data provided by the applicant, petitioner or complainant.

BG_174	2	The Minister of Energy Temenuzhka Petkova has issued an order assigning to TPP Maritsa-East 2 an annual electricity production quota of 2.6 megawatts, which is 8.4% of the total electricity production.
BG_174	3	This she told the energy committee in parliament.
BG_174	4	Her order is based on the Energy Act, which allows the minister to mandate up to 15% of the total amount of electricity generated.
BG_174	5	The plant was not included by the EWRC in the mix of electricity that NEK buys for the regulated market because its price is high and will make electricity more expensive for households.
BG_174	6	For this reason, it also sells hard on the open market.
BG_174	7	The state-owned plant's electricity is becoming more expensive because of carbon buying.
BG_174	8	By contracting generation, the plant receives the difference between its regulated and generation cost from the Electric System Security Fund.
BG_174	9	The Minister has sent her order to the EWRC, to the Electricity System Security Fund, to the Electricity System Operator.
BG_174	10	Petkova reported to the MPs how the government has implemented the parliament's decision of 31 January to rescue the state-owned thermal power plant.
BG_174	11	The MPs ordered to increase the capital of Maritsa-East 2, which has been implemented and the company is stabilized and working in a normal rhythm, the energy minister reported.
BG_174	12	The second task, which was not to allow the plant to be shut down in the long term, has also been fulfilled by the issued order, Petkova further explained.
BG_174	13	"The National Assembly also mandated Bulgaria to join the ""Coal Regions in Transition"" platform without committing to shutting down the plants."
BG_174	14	A letter was sent on June 1, with which we joined without making any commitments, Petkova said.
BG_174	15	At the meeting the MEPs from the Energy Committee voted for the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement between Bulgaria and Greece for the gas connection between the two countries.
BG_174	16	It regulates the financial, tax and legal parameters of the pipeline.

BG_178	11	In his words, more than 30% of Bulgarian citizens already possess and effectively use the COVID certificate, which provides them with access to the public places where the restrictive measures were imposed.
BG_178	12	According to the Minister of Transport, Information Technology and Communications Hristo Alexiev, nearly 50 000 of the employees in schools and kindergartens already have the document, which allows them to perform their duties in the conditions of tightened anti-epidemic measures.
BG_178	13	"""We are proud that Bulgaria was among the first 7 countries that started issuing the document 30 days before the European Regulation (EU) 2021/953 became mandatory for all EU countries and among the first 4 countries that started validation of the electronic COVID certificate"", said Minister Hristo Alexiev."
BG_178	14	So far, the system has generated a total of 3.563 million certificates.
BG_178	15	Of these, about 1.5 million documents a completed vaccination cycle, and nearly 17 000 documents a booster dose.

BG_192	2	26 MES launches e-lessons in autumn
BG_192	3	A free unified e-learning platform will welcome students, teachers and parents at the start of the next school year.
BG_192	4	It will be installed on the cloud environment of the Ministry of Education and Science (MES), and access to it will be with the electronic profiles in edu.mon.
BG_192	5	This is the next step in the digitalization of education in Bulgaria and precedes the introduction of personalized learning, BTA reports.
BG_192	6	The platform will consist of five separate modules united in a common framework.
BG_192	7	"Students will use a ""digital backpack""."
BG_192	8	The user interface will be the same for everyone, regardless of the distance learning platform used by the school.
BG_192	9	The content itself will be filtered and presented to students according to their curriculum.
BG_192	10	The module will also provide access to a repository of personalised digital learning content, defined by the teacher and targeted to the specific student.
BG_192	11	This way he will get all the information he needs for his studies in one place, instead of searching for it in different places on the Internet.
BG_192	12	The new platform allows teachers to create their own digital learning content - lessons, exercises, tests.
BG_192	13	For their production they will have the opportunity to use a huge amount of available electronic resources - texts, images, interactive presentations, 3D models, video and audio clips, virtual and augmented reality.
BG_192	14	In addition to being able to prepare modern and interesting lessons for their students, teachers will be able to offer their lessons for national use in a special module.
BG_192	15	They will be assessed by two experts - a university lecturer and a subject specialist.
BG_192	16	Approved lessons will be made available to all other teachers and their authors will be paid.
BG_192	17	A budget of more than BGN 1.2 million is foreseen for this.
BG_192	18	"The aim is to create a ""bank"" of quality interactive lessons, exercises and tests developed by teachers, covering all subjects and topics in general education."
BG_192	19	In a separate analysis module, the MES will be able to track which e-learning lessons and tools are used most frequently, what results are achieved in individual subjects, grouped by region, age group, school type and a range of other criteria.
BG_192	20	The processing of this data will support management decisions to improve learning and raise achievement.
BG_192	21	The platform will also be useful for parents, who will also be given access.
BG_192	22	They will receive specific information about what their children are learning, how they are doing in the different subjects, what their grades are and their weekly schedule.
BG_192	23	In parallel with the implementation of the platform, extensive training for teachers will be organized. 6,200 teachers will learn to create quality interactive lessons based on an established methodology, and another 12,000 - to work with the platform and use the structured content in the learning process.
BG_192	24	"Together with the Sofia University ""Kliment Ohridski"", 2200 teachers will be trained in programming/coding, cybersecurity and intellectual property protection."
BG_192	25	Over the next three years, the Ministry of Education will invest BGN 24 417 000 in the unified electronic educational platform.
BG_192	26	"The funds were provided under the project ""Education for Tomorrow"" of the Operational Programme ""Science and Education for Smart Growth"" 2014-2020, co-financed by the European Union through the European Structural and Investment Funds."
BG_192	27	The contractor of the project, the Digital Backpack consortium, was selected through a tender process under the Public Procurement Act.

BG_203	1	GERB in vain wants a moratorium on the withdrawal of new debt
BG_203	2	The Treasury has no intention to issue new government debt in December.
BG_203	3	The ministry was forced to explain this once again after GERB today called in parliament to impose a moratorium on new debt.
BG_203	4	Caretaker Finance Minister Valeri Belchev has already announced during the week that there will be no more debt issues this year and that the state budget will probably end 2021 with a slight surplus.
BG_203	5	GERB, however, is worried and asked for a ban on new commitments until the budget for next year is adopted, in which the new rulers take responsibility to the voters on the issue.
BG_203	6	Former Finance Minister Kiril Ananiev said that the fiscal reserve at the end of November had BGN 12 billion, which ensures the implementation of the budget.
BG_203	7	This concern is quite exaggerated.
BG_203	8	Ananiev personally made the budget for 2021 and the GERB MPs adopted it with a deficit of BGN 4.9 billion (3.6% of GDP), which must be covered by issuing new state debt.
BG_203	9	For this purpose, GERB voted a year ago a 4.5 billion lev ceiling on the newly taken debt.
BG_203	10	Subsequently, in the budget update under the previous National Assembly, the deficit was reduced to BGN 4.7 billion.
BG_203	11	Since the beginning of the year BGN 3.8 billion of government securities have been issued on the domestic market.
BG_203	12	BGN 1 billion of them were disposed of during the regular government of Boyko Borissov.
BG_203	13	The remaining BGN 2.8 billion were issued in the last three months by the caretaker cabinet.
BG_203	14	"The ceiling of 4.5 billion BGN will obviously not be reached and GERB's warnings about ""enslaving future generations"" look more like black PR."
BG_203	15	The issue of the state debt has stirred the public in recent days after caretaker Finance Minister Valery Belchev announced that his draft budget for 2022 plans a debt ceiling of BGN 10-12 billion.
BG_203	16	The amount is huge against the background of the announced budget deficit for next year of 2.9% of GDP.
BG_203	17	The parameters of the budget are not yet known, but this 2.9% of GDP is equivalent to no more than BGN 4 billion.
BG_203	18	Belchev has already explained that 1/3 of the new debt will go to cover old debts that mature in early 2022.
BG_203	19	According to him, Bulgaria should look for this financing on the international markets.
BG_203	20	The Cpaĸa in the Ministry of Finance shows that in the first quarter of 2022.
BG_203	21	Bulgaria has to repay a debt of BGN 3 billion.
BG_203	22	Economic.bg recalls that more than 80% of it is an external loan, drawn in 2015 by GERB with Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov, and the remaining 20% are domestic issues, placed in 2012 by another GERB finance minister - Simeon Dyanĸov.
BG_203	23	Today, after the GERB briefing, the Finance Ministry explained that the set limit is about BGN 10 billion and will be spent on refinancing old debt, financing the planned budget deficit in 2022, which is related to the implementation of policies in the social sphere, recovery and business development.
BG_203	24	The remaining part will be used to secure resources for direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the Republic of Bulgaria.
BG_205	1	What are Kiril Petkov and Assen Vassilev aiming at?
BG_205	2	11:47
BG_205	3	A political tsunami or a storm in a glass of water will be the new party?
BG_205	4	A political tsunami or a storm in a glass of water will be the party of Kiril Petkov and Assen Vassilev?
BG_205	5	This is the question after the two Harvard residents announced on Thursday that they will run in the parliamentary elections.
BG_205	6	"Party members pessimistically called them a ""failed project""."
BG_205	7	But it became clear what they don't have.
BG_205	8	They have no party structures.
BG_205	9	They are neither left nor right.
BG_205	10	They are not engineering because they do not have a mandate holder.
BG_205	11	They are not a presidential party either, although they are very supportive of Rumen Radev's views and principles.It became clear what they want - power to continue the change.On September 16th, the ordinary ministers, who were collecting likes on Facebook and impressing with the Hollywood smile of one and the intent gaze of the other, became extraordinary partisans.
BG_205	12	"Yet ""unborn Petkov"", as the ABV leader called the project, became the most discussed political topic."
BG_205	13	A. the Harvard boys will try to put an emblem. of their own know-how - how to win elections in less than two months with a party from scratch or even without it.
BG_205	14	Out of over 200 parties, surely at least one would gladly give them their registration immediately to get into party circulation.
BG_205	15	But the two fledgling politicians do not want that.Another concern they have yet to refute is that they are stepping into the role of party investors who like a small but successful brand and like real financial services absorb and assimilate it in exchange for a few seats.
BG_205	16	Because many of their political opponents will recall that this type of business the two have not only studied, but have already practically applied it in business.Although the project of the young Harvard students is stretching the sails in the rough political sea, a so far unnoticeable wave has taken it over.
BG_205	17	Emil Georgiev, leader of the Ecoglasnost party, which is a long-time partner in the BSP coalition, told how while they were still caretaker ministers Kiril Petkov and Assen Vassilev went to his office and offered him a business deal right in front of his eyes.
BG_205	18	"""Ecoglasnost"" to become part of their project against parliamentary seats."
BG_205	19	Moreover, they stressed that they would finance anything as long as they get full control over the party.
BG_205	20	"And whether to understand that behind them is the presidential institution in the person of Radev's secretary Nikolai Koprinkov."""
BG_205	21	"We tried to take ""Ecoglasnost"" from ""BSP for Bulgaria""!"
BG_205	22	, Petkov confirmed to journalists after handing over the economic post to his current deputy Daniela Vezieva.
BG_205	23	So at least he showed that he was true to his principle of not dodging about sanctified secret meetings.
BG_205	24	Whether he will remain faithful to Radev, however, it is still very early to guess.
BG_205	25	Initial suspicions that they would be direct competitors of Democratic Bulgaria quickly dissipated, especially after top economist Nikolay Vassilev called them leftist ultra-populists.
BG_205	26	"And on Thursday, the two admitted that they were chasing the centre-left electorate, saying ""we believe a lot in right-wing tools to achieve left-wing goals""."
BG_205	27	According to them, this means not raising taxes, attracting investment, freeing businesses from corruption, higher incomes for pensioners, better healthcare and education.Of course, there is a possibility that as excellent stock traders Petkov and Vassilev are playing a double, even triple and quadruple complicated game.
BG_205	28	To harvest BSP votes, following the insufficiently strong red position in support of Radev.
BG_205	29	On the other hand, they are a mouthpiece against the ITN, which drew attention to the dual citizenship and at the same time supported Radev for a second term.
BG_205	30	And whether they will become the surprise of the elections depends on whether their huge ambitions will meet the brutal political reality.
BG_215	1	Atanas Zafirov:
BG_215	2	If parliament worked, we could have already capped gas, heating, electricity and water prices
BG_215	3	Bulgarians are most interested in rising inequalities, inflation, energy prices, prices of basic necessities.
BG_215	4	Inflation can be fought in various ways and one of them is raising incomes.
BG_215	5	"Instead of going around the TV studios, the MPs should have already been on the banks in Parliament, working and passing laws to help the people."""
BG_215	6	-Chairman of the BSP Atanas Zafirov on the air of NovaNews.
BG_215	7	"In the programme ""Your Day"" he described as unusual the extension of the deadline for the start of the National Assembly."
BG_215	8	I'm talking about missed opportunities - we could have already capped gas, heating, electricity and water prices.
BG_215	9	This is an anti-inflationary measure and is expected by the Bulgarian citizens.
BG_215	10	"Another measure is raising incomes, encouraging investments, supporting business - these are the real measures"", the socialist added."
BG_215	11	"As MP from the Vratsa region, Zafirov presented a law for the development of the Northwest, which the Left has been demanding for years. ""This will create a state fund in which the state will give 100 million every year to overcome the region's lagging behind, including by encouraging investors, incentives for them, industrial zones with state and municipal participation,"" he explained."
BG_215	12	"The BSP, whenever we propose a solution, always tells the way it will be implemented, including where the money will come from,"" Atanas Zafirov said and continued."
BG_215	13	"The other way is to redistribute the profits of the energy companies - we have done it with the state-owned ones, but it should be done with the private ones,"" he said."
BG_215	14	"In his words, most of the things that ""We Continue the Change"" proposes are copied from the BSP, but the left is not affected."
BG_215	15	On the contrary, it means that we are on the right track, including when we persuaded them in Parliament for these measures.
BG_215	16	"We see they are ripe now, no harm, let's do it together,"" he said."
BG_215	17	According to Atanas Zafirov, the projected decrease in the price of natural gas is due to the launch of the interconnector with Greece.
BG_215	18	I am afraid that these estimates were made until the end of the year, and for next year there is no clarity on how the 1/3 deficit will be filled.
BG_215	19	"The general solution to the problem stands, so I would not rule out any of the potential suppliers lightly,"" he said."
BG_215	20	On the topic of Ambassador Mitrofanova's presence at the opening of the National Assembly, the socialist explained that the state has a protocol and rules that must be respected.
BG_215	21	He shares the opinion of the people from the regions he speaks to, namely that this is currently a non-essential topic.
BG_215	22	"Any participation of Bulgaria in any form of escalation of this conflict harms Bulgarian national interests"", Atanas Zafirov said at the end."

BG_217	2	ITN and DB in dispute over anti-inflation measures
BG_217	3	Author: Standard Agency 21:45
BG_217	4	"Stating that no final decision on the anti-inflationary package is expected tonight, representatives of ""There is such a nation"" and ""Democratic Bulgaria"" entered the council of the ruling four-party coalition."
BG_217	5	"""There is such a nation"" proposes a package of 11 anti-crisis measures."
BG_217	6	Reduction of VAT on gas, electricity, heating and water to 5 percent for the average amount consumed last year, 5 percent VAT for fruit and vegetable producers and zero VAT for the production of bread and bakery products are part of the measures, Lyubomir Karimanski announced.
BG_217	7	"He stressed that most insist on the introduction of a non-taxable minimum of 500 leva, not accepting a pension increase of 21 percent with a minimum pension of 450 leva: ""Of our proposals, I think the non-taxable minimum is essential."
BG_217	8	On pensions, I am strongly opposed to flattening the threshold between the minimum and average pensions.
BG_217	9	How do you imagine people who want to be insured to get an average pension of 480 leva and the minimum pension to become 450.
BG_217	10	"Where is the principle of solidarity, it is lost"", Karimanski said."
BG_217	11	"Democratic Bulgaria does not accept the idea of ""There are such people"" for a tax-free minimum on 500 leva of income."
BG_217	12	They are also against differentiated rates on goods that are not at regulated prices, such as bread and books, for example, as they believe they will not be effective.
BG_217	13	"Vladislav Panev on the priorities of Democratic Bulgaria: ""For us it is important to have a reduction of VAT on regulated prices, such as heating and gas, because this automatically means lower prices for end consumers."
BG_217	14	"It is important that the measures are properly targeted, i.e. that compensation does not benefit people or businesses that do not need it."""
BG_217	15	"""Democratic Bulgaria"" also insists on reducing the interest for late payments, increasing the VAT registration threshold to 100 thousand BGN and 9% VAT for heating, gas and electricity."
BG_217	16	The measures discussed this evening will be discussed in the different formations.
BG_217	17	Earlier today, BSP Deputy Chairman Georgi Svilensky said that from July 1 pensions will be indexed by 21%:
BG_217	18	"""It is all a matter of the bills the finance minister will present today."
BG_217	19	"We are glad that most of these costly measures are indeed finding support and financial backing within these two billion leva"", Svilensky said."
BG_217	20	At the same time, national statistics reported an annual inflation of over 14% and a monthly inflation of nearly 3%.
BG_217	21	The largest increases were in food, clothing, footwear and transport.
BG_219	1	President Rumen Radev: Any party with ambition for public support...
BG_219	2	Sofia.
BG_219	3	Obviously, the political crisis in the country is deepening and every party with ambitions for public support should announce what way out it proposes.
BG_219	4	This is what President Rumen Radev told journalists, the Press Service of the Presidency reported.
BG_219	5	Asked about the upcoming handing over of a mandate to form a government, he pointed out that the issue of power does not cancel the responsibility of political parties to the citizens and the state.
BG_219	6	"""The rapid and fruitless exhaustion of the procedure for forming a government will leave many important issues unresolved, the Head of State stressed."
BG_219	7	He added that if the parliament is dissolved before the end of July, it means the elections will be held in September, which poses a risk of low turnout.
BG_219	8	On the other hand, the excessive prolongation of the procedure for forming a government leads to temptation for gambling decisions and personnel changes, and the parties themselves are drawing thicker and thicker red lines among themselves and forming a government after potential early elections is becoming more and more difficult.
BG_219	9	The head of state announced that if the second mandate to form a government is returned unfulfilled, he will invite all parliamentary parties for consultations before handing over the third mandate.
BG_219	10	At them they will be able to propose formulas for a way out of the crisis, as well as priorities around which to seek unity.
BG_219	11	The President said that on this basis he would decide to whom to hand the third mandate.
BG_219	12	"""Our society expects a capable governing majority that will immediately proceed to solve the acute social problems, incomes, prices, inflation, to seek long-term and sustainable solutions in the energy sector, the economy and investments,"" the President said."
BG_219	13	In his words, it is also necessary to strengthen security both externally and individually for every citizen and business, to conduct an effective judicial reform, as well as a real fight against corruption and abuse of power.
BG_219	14	The president pointed out that if the parties' choice is again early elections, it would be appropriate to hold them in early October so that a new parliament has legitimacy through increased citizen participation in the vote.
BG_219	15	In the head of state's words, this means that in the remaining days until the end of July the parliament will be burdened with great expectations both for the formation of a governing majority and for the adoption of important laws, and the government - with anti-crisis actions and the development of laws related to the Recovery and Sustainability Plan.
BG_219	16	"""I expect a governing majority that will not use slogans and PR, but real and consistent work to commit to Bulgaria's European integration and to prevent our country from remaining on the periphery of Europe,"" the Head of State further said."
BG_224	1	Ridiculous excuses
BG_224	2	Undoubtedly, Bulgaria's postponed entry into the euro area from January 1st next year is a positive decision.
BG_224	3	Our country is not ready and the attitudes among most Bulgarians are very negative.
BG_224	4	The caretaker cabinet, however, and personally Finance Minister Rositsa Velkova continue to miss the real reasons for this - the impoverishment of the people due to high inflation and the turmoil in our economy that is pulling it along the familiar downward spiral.
BG_224	5	Instead, we hear about 4 laws, which had to be urgently adopted by the next parliament, and excuses for the constantly rising inflation.
BG_224	6	In this regard, it must be said that it is not the lack of legislation, but the failure of the caretaker cabinet to address the rampant profiteering that is at the root of the unjustified rise in the price of goods and services.
BG_224	7	Some will argue about the high prices of energy sources, but let us remember the fact that the military operation in Ukraine was just an occasion for our country to be pushed into a diversification of gas sources, which is rather ridiculous.
BG_224	8	Because it's ridiculous to have an annual gas contract at bargain prices but do nothing to get the agreed amount.
BG_224	9	And instead to bring in an intermediary who first ate some 100 million as commission and the second time pushed the country with a top of BGN 1 billion.
BG_224	10	Not to mention that the gas is still Russian, but much more expensive.
BG_224	11	Not to mention that the clause in the contract is 'take or pay', which means that we have to pay the agreed quantities to Gazprom in any case.
BG_224	12	And if we give up, as we did with the Belene reactors, arbitration could follow.
BG_224	13	However, when we talk about economic growth - energy is a major factor shaping competitiveness.
BG_224	14	Apart from energy sovereignty, which we are about to lose.
BG_224	15	Because of the extremely irresponsible decisions taken by the caretaker cabinet.
BG_224	16	For example, with the contracts for diversification of nuclear fuel supplies to Kozloduy NPP.
BG_224	17	One is made under a Russian license, but the supplier is Western.
BG_224	18	The other has come under serious criticism from nuclear experts.
BG_224	19	In the end, exactly what serious analysts have been warning about for more than ten years has come true: diversification of energy sources means a serious rise in energy prices and pressure on the economy.
BG_224	20	But it wouldn't.
BG_224	21	The voice of reason is the last thing that interests the right-centred Euro-Atlantic adepts in our village.
BG_224	22	Russian to them means hostile and that is why we have to break away.
BG_224	23	Even at the cost of Bulgaria turning from a net exporter of energy into a net importer.
BG_224	24	The other day one such analyst said that what if we were going to import electricity, there was nothing wrong with that.
BG_224	25	"The gentleman in question obviously did not experience the ""energy disco"" in 1985, when electricity was available for two or three hours even in the coldest months."
BG_224	26	If today it is warm and bright in our homes, it is due to the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, to the energy sector that was built under socialism.
BG_224	27	Absolutely nothing built this democracy, which is easily turning into a pure autocracy and totalitarianism before our eyes.
BG_224	28	Garnished, of course, with creeping censorship and fearful inequalities in our society.
BG_224	29	That is why it is important on the eve of the upcoming elections that everyone realises that the path we are walking leads to terrifying depths from which it is difficult, and sometimes even impossible, to crawl.
BG_224	30	Because in the material world the development of the national economy, not the euro and vassal politics, can pull us to a clean and bright place.

DE_001	1	Keeping an eye on corporations
DE_001	2	National tax systems and competition between countries have opened up countless loopholes for corporations.
DE_001	3	Some companies have perfected the shifting of profits and licenses to such an extent that they almost only pay the tax authorities in low-tax countries.
DE_001	4	Efforts have been underway worldwide for years to reduce the opportunities for tax avoidance, but progress is only being made at a snail's pace.
DE_001	5	This is now set to change: At their meeting at the weekend, the finance ministers of the Group of 20 largest industrialized and emerging countries agreed to find a consensus on the issue of taxation of globally operating companies by the middle of the year.
DE_001	6	This was stated by Italian Finance Minister Daniele Franco on Friday after the meeting.
DE_001	7	The reform, which is intended to affect large companies in the digital sector in particular, had previously been blocked by the US government under Donald Trump.
DE_001	8	The latter insisted on the safe harbor clause, which would ultimately have allowed US companies to choose their own taxation system.
DE_001	9	The new Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, on the other hand, is committed to multilateralism and binding rules for all.
DE_001	10	The details are now to be negotiated by the OECD, the club of industrialized countries.
DE_001	11	Meanwhile, the EU has made some progress on another issue: tax transparency.
DE_001	12	After Portugal took over the Council Presidency from Germany in January, the five-year blockade of one of the most sensitive projects was eased.
DE_001	13	At the end of last week, the economy ministers of the member states agreed on a proposal that requires multinational companies to report publicly on what profits they make in which EU country, how much tax they pay and where they do so.
DE_001	14	This should make particularly brazen trickery impossible.
DE_001	15	Country-by-country reporting already exists, but due to the different practices of the EU member states and companies, the figures have so far tended to lack transparency.
DE_001	16	This was the conclusion of a recent study by the Leibniz Center for European Economic Research and the University of Mannheim on the balance sheets of financial service providers.
DE_001	17	Ultimately, it remains to be seen how high the tax payments actually are in the individual countries.
DE_001	18	This is now set to change.
DE_001	19	This is based on a Commission proposal from 2016, according to which companies operating in the EU with an annual turnover of more than 750 million euros must disclose how much profit they generate in the individual member states and how much tax they pay there.
DE_001	20	They will also have to state how much tax they pay outside the EU in total.
DE_001	21	Numerous countries such as Luxembourg, Malta, Cyprus, Ireland and Germany have so far blocked Brussels' initiative.
DE_001	22	However, there was now a majority in favor in the Council of Ministers - Germany abstained, for which Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) blamed the CDU/CSU.
DE_001	23	The issue of taxation in particular shows the weaknesses of the economically liberal Maastricht Treaty and the EU's entire regulatory framework.
DE_001	24	Tax issues must then be approved unanimously by the finance ministers, which is not possible due to opposition from financial havens.
DE_001	25	The decisive factor was a move by the EU Commission to no longer classify the issue as a tax issue.
DE_001	26	This means that a qualified majority of economic ministers is sufficient for country-by-country reporting.
DE_001	27	This was achieved by Austria's pivot.
DE_001	28	Now the European Parliament still has to give its approval.
DE_001	29	While business associations criticize the plans, critics of tax justice are full of praise: Tobias Hauschild from Oxfam Germany speaks of an important first step towards more transparency in corporate taxation.
DE_001	30	Multinational companies must finally make their fair contribution to financing the community.
DE_001	31	The Greens' financial expert in the European Parliament, Sven Giegold, sees country-specific transparency as a minimum requirement for companies with maximum impact for the common good.
DE_001	32	Disclosure would make tax tricks virtually impossible.
DE_001	33	Among other things, Giegold alludes to the Luxleaks affair. In 2014, two ex-employees of a business consultancy brought to light how Luxembourg used special tax deals to attract many companies to open a branch there in order to pay extremely little tax.
DE_001	34	However, numerous other low-tax countries in the EU also benefit from previously non-transparent balance sheet arrangements.
DE_001	35	The political pressure was recently increased by the Apple case.
DE_001	36	The EU Commission had wanted to force the US multinational to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, which had granted it special conditions.
DE_001	37	The EU court in Luxembourg annulled the additional claim.
DE_001	38	The ruling made it clear that tax dodging cannot be stopped with the current regulations.
DE_002	1	Merger plans of Fiat Chrysler and Renault off the table
DE_002	2	The merger was intended to make Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Renault the third largest car manufacturer.
DE_002	3	However, after the French side postponed the talks, FCA withdrew its offer completely.
DE_002	4	The regret also sounded a little offended.
DE_002	5	The planned merger between Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Renault is off the table.
DE_002	6	"Surprisingly, FCA withdrew its offer on Thursday night ""with immediate effect"", after Renault had previously hesitated to accept the offer of talks at all at the request of the French state."
DE_002	7	Renault did not initially comment on the FCA decision.
DE_002	8	It has become clear that the political conditions for such a merger to be successful are not currently in place in France, the Italian-American car manufacturer announced in a statement in London early on Thursday morning.
DE_002	9	FCA remains convinced that the merger proposal was convincing and would have brought benefits for all parties, it said.
DE_002	10	Renault had previously announced that a decision on formal merger talks would once again be postponed.
DE_002	11	The board of directors had discussed the merger offer, but could no longer make a decision as government representatives requested the postponement, Renault said.
DE_002	12	Renault is very interested.
DE_002	13	Last week, FCA made public its intention to merge with Renault.
DE_002	14	Together, the companies could have become the world's third-largest car manufacturer and challenged the market leaders Volkswagen and Toyota.
DE_002	15	Fiat Chrysler had proposed that both groups - i.e. FCA and Renault - each hold half of the new company.
DE_002	16	Together, they would account for 8.7 million vehicles per year.
DE_002	17	Renault reacted with interest immediately after the Italian-American group's offer was published.
DE_002	18	The French state, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, also reacted positively.
DE_002	19	However, France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire warned on Wednesday against too much haste in the talks.
DE_002	20	"""Let's take the time to do things properly,"" Le Maire told the BFMTV television station."
DE_002	21	The collapse of the merger with FCA is not the only bad news for Renault at the moment.
DE_002	22	Le Maire explained that charges would be brought in the affair surrounding former top manager Carlos Ghosn.
DE_002	23	If the state is a shareholder in a company, it must ensure that its management functions well.
DE_002	24	The judiciary would then have to decide on the matter, the minister told BFMTV.
DE_002	25	Le Maire did not initially say by when the complaint should be submitted.
DE_002	26	Renault had discovered dubious expenses totaling around eleven million euros at a subsidiary in the Netherlands.
DE_002	27	As the Renault Board of Directors announced on Tuesday evening, this concerns, among other things, the costs of air travel for former Group CEO Ghosn.
DE_002	28	Legal action against Ghosn should also be considered in the Netherlands.
DE_002	29	"""Problematic"" expenditure."
DE_002	30	A review of the joint subsidiary with the Japanese partner Nissan confirmed initial indications that there were also shortcomings there with regard to financial transparency and procedures for controlling expenditure.
DE_002	31	"The audit found ""problematic"" spending over a period within the past ten years, Nissan said in a statement on Wednesday."
DE_002	32	Among other things, it is about costs for private trips as well as gifts and donations whose purpose was unclear or inappropriate, it said.
DE_002	33	The review is ongoing, according to Nissan.
DE_002	34	Following Ghosn's arrest in Japan, the Franco-Japanese automotive alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, which he had created and controlled, was plunged into a serious crisis.
DE_002	35	Ghosn had been accused of violating stock market regulations in Japan.
DE_014	1	Environmental policy : CO2 tax on fuel and heating - What does it mean for whom?
DE_014	2	The three of them have already calculated what this would mean for the pensioner in the country, the childless couple with two cars and the family in the city.
DE_014	3	"However, SPD politician Schulze emphasizes that this is not a concept, and certainly not hers, but a ""contribution to the debate""."
DE_014	4	The grand coalition will be in for a rough ride, as there are staunch opponents of a CO2 price in the CDU/CSU.
DE_014	5	"What is very important to the SPD is that if the CO2 price is introduced, for example as a tax surcharge on fossil fuels and heating fuels, Schulze's plans envisage the money not going into the state's coffers, but being returned to citizens as a ""climate premium""."
DE_014	6	Companies should also receive something in return, for example through funding programs.
DE_014	7	"In any case, a ""comprehensive package of measures"" is needed, emphasizes Schulze, because the CO2 price is not a ""panacea"" - but a building block."
DE_014	8	This is how it could look, based on studies by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Cycle Research of the Hans Böckler Foundation and the Forum for an Ecological and Social Market Economy (FÖS):
DE_014	9	From 2020, there will be a surcharge on energy taxes on diesel, petrol, heating oil and natural gas.
DE_014	10	To start with, this amounts to 35 euros per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced during combustion.
DE_014	11	However, this will increase rapidly until it reaches 180 euros in 2030.
DE_014	12	This introductory price would mean that diesel and heating oil would become around 11 cents more expensive per liter, petrol by not quite ten cents and natural gas by just under one cent per kilowatt hour.
DE_014	13	Approximately 3 cents would be added per step of ten euros.
DE_014	14	"A ""climate premium"" is to go back to the citizens, for example 80 euros per person per year to start with - regardless of age or income."
DE_014	15	Companies should not get the money back just like that, but rather through support programs.
DE_014	16	In the future, part of the revenue could also be used to reduce the electricity tax and make electricity - ideally green electricity from wind and solar power, for example - cheaper from a climate protection perspective.
DE_014	17	It is difficult to predict how often people would leave their car at home, turn down the heating, switch to an electric car or install new windows because of a CO2 price.
DE_014	18	By 2030, 6 to 22 percent of greenhouse gases could be saved in the areas of transport and heating, which would correspond to 19 to 74 million tons of CO2 per year, says FÖS expert Uwe Nestle.
DE_014	19	However, this does not include technological leaps, which the CO2 price is intended to promote.
DE_014	20	What that means for whom depends on many factors: How much fuel the car guzzles, how much you drive, what kind of heating the house has, how economically or generously you heat, how big the house or apartment is.
DE_014	21	The DIW has calculated examples based on average values:
DE_014	22	"As the ""climate bonus"" is paid per head, families with children have an advantage."
DE_014	23	Parents with one child who both work, live in rented accommodation and do not have their own car could have an extra 27 euros a month in their pockets.
DE_014	24	A couple with two children, a rented apartment in the city and a car would have five euros more per month.
DE_014	25	In contrast, parents with three children, two cars and a home in the countryside, from where the main earner commutes over 20 kilometers a day, would have one euro less per month.
DE_014	26	"For the ""double income, no children"" model plus your own house and two cars, the CO2 price could mean paying an extra 12 euros per month at the start."
DE_014	27	If you are raising one or two children on your own, you could make a mini-plus of three euros.
DE_014	28	A pensioner with a car who rents in the country would have about one euro less per month and therefore almost no additional costs.
DE_014	29	An employee without children who rents a car pays five euros more.
DE_014	30	A student in the city could have five euros more a month.
DE_014	31	Schulze does not rule out extra help - for commuters, for example.
DE_014	32	"Unlike in Switzerland, for example, where companies get money back depending on the wage bill, Schulze does not want to distribute it ""with a watering can""."
DE_014	33	It wants to help those who are particularly affected, such as midwives, tradespeople, nursing and care services who are often on the move.
DE_014	34	Schulze mentions an investment cost subsidy for the purchase of electric cars as one possibility.
DE_014	35	She would consider exceptions for logistics and transport companies that are in international competition.
DE_021	1	A little looser
DE_021	2	The exit restrictions for the residents of the Göttingen residential complex, where more than 120 people have been infected with coronavirus, continue to apply, but have been relaxed somewhat:
DE_021	3	Anyone who has tested negative twice has been allowed to leave the building since Monday evening under certain conditions and in groups of three at most.
DE_021	4	Anyone who wants to go shopping or take their dog for a walk must wear a mask and sign in and out at the cordoned-off entrances to the site.
DE_021	5	On Monday evening and Tuesday morning, according to observations, only a few residents of the complex were initially out and about.
DE_021	6	Around 700 people, including around 200 children and young people, live in extremely cramped conditions in the complex.
DE_021	7	Many are Hartz IV recipients and migrants.
DE_021	8	After the coronavirus outbreak, which initially infected around 100 people, the city had the apartment block sealed off and quarantined.
DE_021	9	The residents are supplied with food by the city administration and aid organizations.
DE_021	10	On Saturday, there were violent clashes at one of the entrances.
DE_021	11	Up to 100 residents had tried to break through the barriers.
DE_021	12	They were pushed back by the police using massive amounts of pepper spray.
DE_021	13	Objects flew at the officers from the courtyard and from windows, and eight were injured, a police spokeswoman said.
DE_021	14	One man was provisionally arrested.
DE_021	15	At the same time, up to 250 people demonstrated near the apartment blocks on Saturday against the housing shortage and for decentralized accommodation for the affected families.
DE_021	16	The demand is also made in an online petition to Göttingen's city administration.
DE_021	17	The more than 400 signatories, who had signed the petition by Tuesday morning, stated that the welfare of children in particular was at risk if 700 people were locked up in a confined space.
DE_021	18	The situation is also unbearable for adults.
DE_021	19	Here and elsewhere, it is as much about the state's treatment of people who are already marginalized, about the well-being of hundreds of children, about humanity, said refugee researcher Miriam Schader, who initiated the petition.
DE_021	20	Activists hold a permanent vigil in front of the building.
DE_021	21	On the one hand, the aim is to keep a critical eye on the police and, on the other, to support the residents, they explain.
DE_021	22	In view of the precarious living conditions in the affected block, Göttingen CDU member of parliament Fritz Güntzler called on the city to take action.
DE_021	23	It must finally work on solutions as to how such social hotspots can be changed and better protected in the long term.
DE_021	24	It was looked away for years, looked away for too long.
DE_021	25	The city had rented apartments there in the past.
DE_021	26	The apartments now being traded as junk real estate only found buyers because the city guaranteed the rents.
DE_021	27	Due to the mass corona outbreak, the number of infections in the Göttingen district has risen sharply, reaching 247 on Monday evening.
DE_021	28	The alarm value of 50 infected persons per 100,000 inhabitants in one week has thus been reached, the figure is 50.34.
DE_021	29	At the beginning of May, the Chancellor and the heads of the federal states agreed that consistent measures would be taken to restrict the pandemic if the quota was reached in a district.
DE_021	30	However, there will be no lockdown for the Göttingen district, explained Göttingen's Lord Mayor Rolf-Georg Köhler and District Administrator Bernhard Reuter (both SPD).
DE_021	31	The current corona outbreak is limited to the residential complex on the edge of the city center and is under control, says Köhler.
DE_024	1	In Gaißach: Well looked after in the hall
DE_024	2	Anyone in Gaißach who cares for an elderly relative at home and needs some time to themselves for a day has to get in the car and take them to a day care facility in the area, for example in Bad Tölz.
DE_024	3	This will be easier in future: Rummelsberger Diakonie is opening a new day care center for senior citizens in Gaißach in the former premises of the Oberland workshops.
DE_024	4	Up to 20 senior citizens will be cared for in the former warehouse, which covers around 250 square meters.
DE_024	5	The launch is planned for the spring of next year following a refurbishment.
DE_024	6	"""This is something new that fits very well into the structure of our municipality,"" says Mayor Stefan Fadinger (CSU)."
DE_024	7	The new facility is located in the hall on Egenbergerweg, where Lebenshilfe used to run a small store selling wooden products made by people with disabilities in the Oberland workshops.
DE_024	8	The hall was later leased as a warehouse for ten years.
DE_024	9	"""The idea was to see if it could be used for elderly care,"" says Fadinger."
DE_024	10	"It is personally important to him that family caregivers in Gaißach can take a day off and ""know that their family members are safely accommodated and cared for""."
DE_024	11	In Gaißach, they also offer to pick them up from home and bring them back in the evening.
DE_024	12	The rental agreements with the Rummelsberger Diakonie have already been signed.
DE_024	13	"He believes in ""a good partnership"" with this sponsor, says Mayor Fadinger."
DE_024	14	The Rummelsberger Diakonie has more than 200 facilities throughout Germany, where around 6,000 senior citizens, refugees, children and young people or people with disabilities are cared for or supported.
DE_024	15	In Upper Bavaria, it currently cares for around 400 elderly people on an inpatient, day-care or outpatient basis.
DE_024	16	At the beginning of 2021, Rummelsberger Diakonie will also take over the Otto outpatient care service in Bad Tölz.
DE_024	17	"""The demand for outpatient day care is constantly increasing, more and more people are caring for their relatives at home and are happy about the relief provided by day care,"" says Christine Meyer, Head of Outpatient Services at Rummelsberger Diakonie für Menschen im Alter GmbH."
DE_024	18	In the new facility in Gaißach, senior citizens are served breakfast, lunch and afternoon coffee.
DE_024	19	In addition to pure care, mental and physical activities are also part of the care concept.
DE_024	20	"The elderly visitors could ""spend the day together"" and ""certainly see many old acquaintances"" again, says Meyer."
DE_024	21	The core hours should be from Monday to Friday, from 8 am to 4 pm.
DE_024	22	"""Of course, half-day bookings are also possible,"" says Christine Meyer."
DE_024	23	However, the hall must first be converted.
DE_024	24	According to Fadinger, a recreation room, a therapy room, a quiet room, a kitchen and sanitary facilities are planned.
DE_024	25	There is also a small terrace outside.
DE_024	26	According to the mayor, the conversion should not be too complicated, as the hall is a self-supporting structure and will not be altered on the outside.
DE_024	27	"However, there could still be delays due to the coronavirus pandemic, ""nobody can predict that""."
DE_024	28	The municipal council in Gaißach will deal with the corresponding change of use of the building at its next meeting on Tuesday, 17.
DE_024	29	November, from 7 p.m., in the auditorium of the Wetzl school.
DE_029	1	"Germany tightens up - ""not enough"" for Merkel"
DE_029	2	At a crisis summit held by German Chancellor Angela Merkel with the 16 state premiers on Wednesday evening, regional coronavirus tightening measures were agreed - however, it was not possible to agree on uniform regulations across Germany.
DE_029	3	The resolutions are not enough for Merkel.
DE_029	4	In view of a record number of new coronavirus cases, the German government urgently called for more discipline and caution on Thursday.
DE_029	5	"Health Minister Jens Spahn and Chancellery Minister Helge Braun emphasized that Germans need to be ""much more careful"" - especially in their free time - in order to be able to celebrate Christmas as usual, among other things."
DE_029	6	The previous evening, the federal and state governments had agreed on new restrictions after eight hours of negotiations.
DE_029	7	Chancellor Merkel (CDU) and the 16 state premiers decided in the Chancellery to impose contact restrictions for all regions in which the number of new coronavirus infections exceeds 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
DE_029	8	The first measures are to take effect as soon as the number of cases reaches 35.
DE_029	9	"""Not tough enough to avert disaster from us"" Merkel had already expressed her dissatisfaction during the meeting: ""Our announcements are not tough enough to avert disaster from us,"" the CDU politician said during the meeting, according to consistent reports from participants."
DE_029	10	With the measures now defined, the federal and state governments would be sitting here again in two weeks' time.
DE_029	11	"""What we are doing here is simply not enough."""
DE_029	12	Spahn calls for more mindfulness at private parties On Thursday, Spahn and Braun underlined Merkel's assessment that not enough had been achieved.
DE_029	13	"Spahn said on Deutschlandfunk radio: ""Together, we have it in our own hands."" It must be clear to citizens that they decide today whether Christmas can take place as usual."
DE_029	14	He called for more vigilance at private parties, where there has recently been an increase in infections.
DE_029	15	"""If we look out for each other together"", then no further measures will be necessary."
DE_029	16	"Chancellery Minister: ""Now is not the time to travel"" Chancellery Minister Braun spoke of an ""enormous infection dynamic""."
DE_029	17	"Germany is at the beginning of a ""very big second wave"", he said on ARD."
DE_029	18	What matters now is the population, Braun emphasized.
DE_029	19	"The Germans need to be ""much more careful""."
DE_029	20	Basically, all contacts would now have to be halved in order to contain the pandemic.
DE_029	21	"""In principle, what we should really be saying is: stay at home - just like we had in March/April."
DE_029	22	"Now is not the time for traveling,"" said Braun."
DE_035	1	When health insurance covers cosmetic surgery for pensioners
DE_035	2	"Better to grow old than look old - many pensioners seem to take this ""wisdom of life"" to heart."
DE_035	3	More and more older people are going under the knife for a fresh and vital appearance.
DE_035	4	In recent years, the average age for cosmetic surgery in Germany has been around 43.
DE_035	5	However, operations of this kind can often be very expensive.
DE_035	6	This begs the question: Does health insurance actually pay for cosmetic surgery for pensioners?
DE_035	7	Cosmetic surgery: Does health insurance pay for cosmetic surgery for pensioners?
DE_035	8	According to Dr. Svenja Giessler, retirees who want cosmetic surgery are less concerned with looking 30 again.
DE_035	9	Rather, they wanted to leave a relaxed, vital and refreshed impression on those around them.
DE_035	10	The specialist reports this on the website of her practice for plastic and aesthetic surgery in Munich.
DE_035	11	"""Their outward appearance should express how old they feel on the inside,"" it says."
DE_035	12	This is why the number of plastic and aesthetic surgery procedures performed on patients over the age of 65 has risen in recent years.
DE_035	13	For many senior citizens, life really gets going when they retire - and they naturally want to reflect this with an appearance that is as fresh as possible.
DE_035	14	Older women in Germany therefore go under the knife more often than men.
DE_035	15	According to Dr. Giessler, neck and forehead facelifts, eyelid lifts and breast operations are particularly popular - the latter, however, primarily to reduce sagging, heavy breasts.
DE_035	16	For older men, eyelid and abdominoplasty are the two most popular reasons for visiting a plastic surgeon.
DE_035	17	Incidentally, there are also some procedures that are not medically necessary - which is why health insurance usually does not pay for cosmetic surgery.
DE_035	18	As the term cosmetic surgery suggests, operations in this category are not usually medically necessary procedures.
DE_035	19	This has an impact on the assumption of costs by statutory health insurance companies.
DE_035	20	This is because if the correction is purely aesthetic, health insurance companies generally do not cover the costs of the procedure.
DE_035	21	In the worst case scenario, cosmetic surgery can also result in further necessary procedures and financial expenses if something has not gone according to plan during the operation.
DE_035	22	Then it becomes really expensive for the person concerned, because according to the consumer advice center, the statutory health insurance company can also ask the insured person to pay for follow-up interventions and reclaim all or part of the sickness benefit for the duration of the treatment.
DE_035	23	To keep fit as a senior, there are also some cosmetic surgery for pensioners: In which cases health insurance will cover the costs.
DE_035	24	The health insurance company only agrees to cover the costs of cosmetic surgery if the procedure is medically necessary.
DE_035	25	This can be the case, for example, with a congenital malformation - a breast reduction can also fall under this term.
DE_035	26	After all, the desire for cosmetic surgery is not always based solely on the desire for a visual change.
DE_035	27	If women with a large bust develop painful postural problems due to their weight or skin diseases develop in the area of the skin folds, the health insurance company will cover the high costs of a breast reduction in individual cases.
DE_035	28	This is reported by the Mannheim Clinic for Plastic Surgery on its website.
DE_035	29	Accordingly, severe psychological stress due to one's own appearance can also be accompanied by approval from the health insurance company.
DE_035	30	However, a psychological report must also be available for this.
DE_035	31	Incidentally, under certain circumstances, dentures for pensioners are also paid for by health insurance. 24hamburg.de newsletter.
DE_035	32	In the 24hamburg.de newsletter, our editorial team compiles content from Hamburg, northern Germany and about HSV.
DE_035	33	Every day at 8:30 a.m., six current articles land in your e-mail inbox - registration is free and you can easily unsubscribe by clicking at the end of each newsletter issue.
DE_035	34	Do health insurance companies pay for cosmetic surgery for pensioners?
DE_035	35	This needs to be checked.
DE_035	36	All in all, it can be summarized that every cosmetic surgery is an individual case when it comes to the question of cost coverage and is examined by the health insurance company upon presentation of a medical indication certificate.
DE_035	37	According to the Mannheim clinic, whether and to what extent the health insurance company will actually cover the costs varies greatly from case to case.
DE_035	38	Pensioners should therefore clarify with their health insurance provider before the procedure whether the costs of cosmetic surgery will be covered.
DE_035	39	According to the consumer advice center, it is helpful to contact the responsible health insurance company directly with a statement from the treating doctors.
DE_051	1	Saudi Arabian woman arrives in asylum in Canada
DE_051	2	After being prevented from being deported to her home country, Saudi Arabian Rahaf Mohammed el-Kunun, who fled from her family, has arrived in Canada.
DE_051	3	Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland personally picked up the young woman at Toronto airport, as photos show.
DE_051	4	Canada had previously offered the 18-year-old asylum - which is likely to put additional strain on the already tense relationship between Canada and the ultra-conservative kingdom.
DE_051	5	"The UN refugee agency UNHCR welcomed El-Kunun's arrival on Twitter and thanked Canada for offering the woman ""protection and a long-term way out""."
DE_051	6	"""It's a pleasure for me this morning to welcome a very brave new Canadian to her new home,"" Freeland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)."
DE_051	7	El-Kunun did not comment at first.
DE_051	8	"""She is naturally very tired after the long journey and wanted to rest first."
DE_051	9	But she wanted the Canadians to see that she is here, that she is doing well and that she is very happy to be in her new home - even though she mentioned the cold to me.
DE_051	10	I told her that it would soon be warmer again.
DE_051	11	El-Kunun was stranded in Bangkok last weekend after she managed to get away from her family during a visit to Kuwait.
DE_051	12	She claims to have been abused and threatened with death.
DE_051	13	The Thai authorities originally wanted to send them back, but then decided against it.
DE_051	14	She succeeded in preventing this with an unprecedented campaign via the short message service Twitter.
DE_051	15	Her case caused a worldwide sensation.
DE_051	16	The United Nations recognized the young woman as a refugee - and used the opportunity to recall the fate of many others who fail to flee for political, economic or other reasons.
DE_051	17	In the meantime, the Saudi Arabian woman has also reactivated her Twitter account, which she had temporarily deactivated following insults and threats: Recent photos showed her sitting on an airplane.
DE_051	18	She is holding her Saudi passport in her hand.
DE_051	19	El-Kunun had escaped from her family during a stay in Kuwait.
DE_051	20	She was allegedly harassed and threatened with death by male relatives.
DE_051	21	She actually wanted to go to Australia.
DE_051	22	On her way there, she landed in Bangkok on Saturday last week, where the authorities initially refused her onward travel at the request of Saudi Arabia.
DE_051	23	It was initially unclear why she had not gone to Australia for asylum.
DE_051	24	The authorities there had already started to check whether she would be granted a visa on humanitarian grounds.
DE_051	25	"The head of the Thai immigration police, Surachate Hakparn, said in Bangkok: ""It was her own wish to go to Canada."
DE_051	26	"The matter is now over for Thailand."""
DE_051	27	The 18-year-old thanked everyone again on Twitter for their support.
DE_051	28	"""Thank you for supporting me and saving my life,"" she wrote."
DE_051	29	"""Honestly, I would never have dreamed of this love and this support."
DE_051	30	"You are the spark that motivates me to become a better person."""
DE_051	31	The case represents a new strain on the already tense relationship between Canada and Saudi Arabia.
DE_051	32	In a tweet last year, Canada's Foreign Minister Freeland expressed her criticism of the arrest of human rights activists in the ultra-conservative kingdom.
DE_051	33	Riyadh reacted indignantly and took a series of countermeasures.
DE_051	34	Among other things, Saudi Arabia expelled the Canadian ambassador and withdrew its ambassador from Ottawa.
DE_051	35	However, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained firm in the diplomatic crisis.
DE_051	36	Among other things, Freeland criticized the arrest of Samar Badawi, sister of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who was also imprisoned.
DE_051	37	His wife Ensaf Haidar also lives in Canada with their three children.
DE_051	38	They have also been granted citizenship of the country.
DE_051	39	Raif Badawi was sentenced to a thousand lashes and ten years in prison in Saudi Arabia.
DE_051	40	UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said that El-Kunun's case showed the difficult situations refugees often find themselves in.
DE_051	41	Unfortunately, only a fraction of the 25.4 million refugees worldwide have the prospect of being accepted in a safe country.
DE_058	1	Kiel scores particularly badly - Home office fiasco in public authorities: State has problems sending employees to work from home
DE_058	2	The German government wants to send Germans to work from home from Wednesday.
DE_058	3	"""Enable people to work from home"" - this is how Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier recently appealed to employers."
DE_058	4	But what does it actually look like where the state is the employer, for example in federal authorities?
DE_058	5	"According to a report in ""Welt am Sonntag"", the home office rate in city administrations and other federal authorities is very modest."
DE_058	6	"A survey of 14 large cities and 16 federal authorities revealed ""that in some cases less than half of office staff are able to work from home"", the newspaper reported."
DE_058	7	Kiel came last in the survey, with only 17 percent of office staff currently working from home.
DE_058	8	"The city administrations of Erfurt with 20.4 percent working from home, Frankfurt with 28 percent, Rostock with ""up to 30 percent"" and Leipzig with 33 percent also scored particularly poorly."
DE_058	9	Supply bottlenecks, files not digitized.
DE_058	10	The federal authorities surveyed were in a slightly better position overall, but there were also outliers.
DE_058	11	"The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees was specifically mentioned, ""where 45 percent of employees can currently work from home""."
DE_058	12	"According to ""Welt am Sonntag"", the main reasons given by administrations and authorities for the implementation problems were that they had only recently ordered work equipment such as laptops and servers and were now facing supply bottlenecks."
DE_058	13	In addition, many files are still not digitized.
DE_058	14	"The Federal Court of Justice, for example, is ""limited"", according to the newspaper, ""because the work is still tied to paper files to a very considerable extent""."
DE_058	15	"The same applies to the Stasi Records Office and the General Customs Directorate, where some files are ""only available at the office""."
DE_058	16	There are also some legal reasons why they have to be processed locally.
DE_058	17	However, the situation in the federal ministries is different.
DE_058	18	A survey by Deutsche Presse-Agentur shows: In many federal ministries in Berlin, there are hardly any civil servants or employees to be found in the buildings - the home office rate is up to 85 percent.
DE_058	19	In Peter Altmaier's (CDU) Ministry of Economic Affairs, for example, less than 20 percent of the 1880 employees work in the office, according to a spokesperson.
DE_058	20	"""Special organizational arrangements have been made for system-relevant functional personnel, such as shift work or alternating team models, in order to reduce contacts in the ministry as much as possible."" This also exists in the other ministries."
DE_058	21	According to official information, all employees in the Ministry of Agriculture (1064 positions), led by Julia Klöckner (CDU), are technically equipped for working from home, with the exception of drivers and messengers.
DE_058	22	"They were advised to ""make use of this to the greatest extent possible""."
DE_058	23	However, there are no statistics on how many do this, said a spokesperson.
DE_058	24	The same can be heard from the Ministry of Health (958 employees) of Jens Spahn (CDU).
DE_078	1	Music: Heavy Metal and Afrobeat
DE_078	2	"Living in Bavarian ""anchor centers"" often means waiting for an asylum decision."
DE_078	3	"André Keller, 40, who everyone calls Levi, wants to offer variety and plays music with residents in the ""Rock The Nations"" project."
DE_078	4	SZ: Levi, as a heavy metal musician, you co-founded Rock The Nations.
DE_078	5	Do the residents in the anchor center now all have to play AC/DC and Iron Maiden?
DE_078	6	Levi: No.
DE_078	7	Quite the opposite!
DE_078	8	We've actually moved away from rock because the musicians play a lot of Afrobeat.
DE_078	9	And reggae.
DE_078	10	Of course, we also gave them some of our rock stuff.
DE_078	11	But all styles of music are represented and welcome.
DE_078	12	You launched the project in January 2020.
DE_078	13	It started - and then came Covid.
DE_078	14	Oh yes.
DE_078	15	Before Corona, we met two or three times a week in the rehearsal room.
DE_078	16	During the first lockdown, we then distributed donated instruments to the rooms so that each musician could continue practicing.
DE_078	17	Then we tried to motivate them: Why don't you record something and make a few videos?
DE_078	18	We have distributed laptops.
DE_078	19	And organized a scavenger hunt, giving the residents in quarantine new tasks every day for 14 days.
DE_078	20	But the problem was the technology.
DE_078	21	"There are currently only two WiFi hotspots in the ""Ankerzentrum""."
DE_078	22	Online rehearsals, giving lessons or sending videos is of course difficult.
DE_078	23	Are there no women in the project?
DE_078	24	Unfortunately not at the moment.
DE_078	25	There were two ladies with us briefly who wanted to sing.
DE_078	26	They are a little more reserved.
DE_078	27	Were you last able to meet?
DE_078	28	We often brought food during the quarantines.
DE_078	29	The boys gave us shopping lists and then we met briefly at the gate.
DE_078	30	At times we were no longer allowed to rehearse.
DE_078	31	Then we tended to meet for coffee in the rehearsal room.
DE_078	32	But getting to the residents was hardly possible in the meantime.
DE_078	33	It's a bit cheesy to say that music doesn't need language, you communicate through the instruments.
DE_078	34	Yes, that's right.
DE_078	35	With three musicians from the Ivory Coast, it was difficult at the beginning because we don't speak French ourselves.
DE_078	36	But with music you always come to a consensus somehow and in the end you have a song.
DE_078	37	The musical language already works.
DE_078	38	The aim is to write your own pieces?
DE_078	39	We tried a few cover songs at the beginning.
DE_078	40	But after five of the boys went to the Bavarian Music Academy in Hammelburg nearby, they started composing.
DE_078	41	One of them has written a play about grievances in Africa.
DE_078	42	So we keep trying.
DE_078	43	What role do experiences of flight or arriving in Germany play?
DE_078	44	That is not easy.
DE_078	45	I tried to find out something about the reasons for fleeing and the route to Germany.
DE_078	46	I have become more cautious.
DE_078	47	We are now waiting more for people to reveal something about themselves.
DE_078	48	Sometimes we learn about the traumatic conditions that prevailed during the escape, and we say: We urgently need to see a psychologist.
DE_078	49	One man's best friend sank next to him on the Mediterranean.
DE_078	50	Once, only 50 percent of a boat arrived on a rescue ship, the rest drowned.
DE_078	51	You need a thick skin to listen to that.
DE_078	52	Making music is also about coming to terms with yourself.
DE_078	53	We initially thought about playing soccer with the boys, but they are too fast for us.
DE_078	54	With the tasks we set them, we want to create a more or less regular daily routine.
DE_078	55	So that they know what they can do tomorrow.
DE_078	56	And part of music is expressing your feelings.
DE_078	57	Whether it's sadness or anger.
DE_078	58	We try to give them an outlet.
DE_078	59	And: to help with her private matters as well as her music.
DE_078	60	How do you keep your group together now?
DE_078	61	Via Whatsapp?
DE_078	62	That too, but mainly via our Facebook page.
DE_078	63	And we write transfer letters to the government.
DE_078	64	"We ask you to leave the musicians in the area after the ""Anchor Center""."
DE_078	65	Two are now in Schweinfurt, one in Bad Kissingen and one in Kitzingen.
DE_078	66	One of them writes hip-hop songs, which we try to pass on to the Würzburg hip-hop scene.
DE_078	67	"In the meantime, music lessons were open again, so we organized individual rehearsals with the ""WiMu"" music school in Würzburg."
DE_078	68	And now we have to continue to support the musicians until we can get going again.
DE_092	1	Not receiving an inflation adjustment premium?
DE_092	2	What employees must now bear in mind
DE_092	3	Due to rising energy costs and food prices, employees now have a chance to receive the inflation compensation bonus.
DE_092	4	Who is entitled to it - and who isn't?
DE_092	5	And what can employees do if they have not received the bonus?
DE_092	6	Food prices and energy costs have been exploding for months.
DE_092	7	Consumers therefore have to dig deeper into their pockets - inflation is also making itself felt in everyday life and experts even fear a wave of bankruptcies.
DE_092	8	Because one thing remains the same for many: the salary.
DE_092	9	In response to the current situation, the German government has therefore introduced the so-called inflation compensation premium.
DE_092	10	And this can even amount to up to 3000 euros - tax and social security free.
DE_092	11	But who actually receives this bonus - and who doesn't?
DE_092	12	And what can employees do if they do not receive an inflation premium?
DE_092	13	echo24.de has asked.
DE_092	14	Inflation adjustment premium: A voluntary benefit paid by the employer.
DE_092	15	"The basis for the bonus is the ""Act on the temporary reduction of the VAT rate on gas supplies via the natural gas network"", explains Volker Henn-Anschütz, lawyer and contributor to the Gefeuert.de portal."
DE_092	16	This regulates the one-off payment made by employers to their employees.
DE_092	17	"But beware, the following generally applies: ""However, there is no legal entitlement to this; it is a voluntary benefit."
DE_092	18	"The only requirement is full-time or part-time employment."" Good news for mini-jobbers, trainees, interns and working students - unlike the self-employed, they are therefore entitled to the bonus payment."
DE_092	19	One-off payment, installment or goods voucher: the inflation premium is so diverse.
DE_092	20	Employers are relatively free to decide how they want to pay out the bonus.
DE_092	21	Whether as a collective one-off payment, in tranches, quarterly until the end of 2024 - or not at all.
DE_092	22	There are even more possibilities.

DE_092	28	Employers cannot offset the payment.
DE_092	29	But does this also mean that employers can now equate the inflation adjustment bonus with the Christmas bonus?
DE_092	30	"In this respect, the labor law expert can answer in the negative: ""The inflation adjustment bonus is not the same as the Christmas bonus."
DE_092	31	"As a result, a contractually agreed Christmas bonus cannot be replaced or offset against this."""
DE_092	32	But what happens if the employer waives the inflation premium altogether?
DE_092	33	Or even cut the annual Christmas bonus?
DE_092	34	Unfortunately, the expert's answer here is less positive: As there is no legal entitlement to the bonus and it is a voluntary benefit from the employer, employees have no legal recourse.
DE_092	35	No inflation premium received?
DE_092	36	The principle of equality can help.
DE_092	37	"But: ""However, a claim may arise from a company agreement on the payment of an inflation adjustment bonus or a corresponding provision in a collective agreement."
DE_092	38	"In addition, a claim may also arise from the so-called principle of equality if an inflation adjustment bonus is paid, but not to all employees or in different, objectively unjustified amounts."""
DE_092	39	"In some cases, patience is also required ""The regulation comes into force retroactively from October 1, 2022 and is limited until December 31, 2024."

DE_095	2	So far, virtually none of the 100 billion euros in special funds has reached the Bundeswehr, said CDU foreign affairs expert Roderich Kiesewetter in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bayern 2, radioWelt am Morgen).
DE_095	3	"""Basically, we lost more to inflation last year and the Bundeswehr spent just 10 billion euros."

DE_095	12	"On Sunday, Pistorius emphasized on the ARD programme ""Bericht aus Berlin"" that the 100 billion euros in special funds were not enough."
DE_095	13	"The budget of the Ministry of Defense must grow significantly ""because otherwise we will not be able to perform the tasks that we have not been able to perform for 30 years""."
DE_095	14	No funds from the special fund were used in the 2022 financial year, but according to the Ministry of Defense, around 30 billion euros have now been budgeted.
DE_095	15	The defense industry complained several times about the sluggish awarding of contracts.
DE_095	16	Pistorius announced that in future, arms companies would receive payments on account for orders instead of being paid on delivery.

DE_097	1	Court hears case on illegal arms exports
DE_097	2	The Mexican state of Guerrero gained notoriety in 2014 when corrupt police officers surrounded buses of students on their way to a demonstration in the city of Iguala.
DE_097	3	The officers opened fire without warning, killing six people. 43 surviving students were then allegedly kidnapped by the police officers, handed over to a drug cartel and executed by them.
DE_097	4	The exact processes are still unclear.
DE_097	5	The fact is that at least seven police officers fired German-made G36 rifles.
DE_097	6	The weapons came from a delivery of around 4,500 rifles that were sold to Mexico between 2006 and 2009 by the Swabian arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch (H&K).
DE_097	7	Officially, the weapons should not have been allowed to enter troubled provinces such as Guerrero.
DE_097	8	A years-long legal battle over the question of the responsibility of German arms companies and the official control bodies is now entering the next stage: on Thursday, the hearing of the appeal in the case of illegal arms exports to Mexico began at the Federal Court of Justice.
DE_097	9	The ruling will point the way for German export licensing practice, Carola Hausotter, coordinator of the German Human Rights Coordination Mexico, told nd.
DE_097	10	Much was still open at the end of the first day of the trial, and a verdict is expected for the 11th day.
DE_097	11	March expected.
DE_097	12	Originally, lawyer Holger Rothbauer and peace activist Jürgen Grässlin from the Armaments Information Office started the process with a complaint in 2010. In 2019, the Stuttgart Regional Court handed down its first verdict against H&K and two former employees.
DE_097	13	The court considered it proven that the license to export the assault rifles to Mexico had been fraudulently obtained using false information.
DE_097	14	The weapons were only supposed to be used in peaceful provinces, but in fact ended up in four regions where human rights violations were commonplace.
DE_097	15	The court sentenced the arms manufacturer to a fine of 3.7 million euros - the sales proceeds from the Mexican business - and the two employees, a sales manager and a clerk, to suspended prison sentences.
DE_097	16	Former District Court President Peter Beyerle, then export officer and managing director at H&K, and two other employees from the management level were acquitted.
DE_097	17	Another defendant was in Mexico and was not included in the proceedings.
DE_097	18	The judges deemed the company's actions to be a gang-related export of goods on the basis of a fraudulent license under the Foreign Trade and Payments Act.
DE_097	19	The company, the two employees and the public prosecutor's office had lodged an appeal.
DE_097	20	The latter does not question the acquittals, but is calling for stricter penalties for the employees.
DE_097	21	So-called end-use certificates are a core element of German arms export transactions.
DE_097	22	In this agreement, the Mexican state undertakes to the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control, for example, to only export the purchased weapons to unproblematic regions of the country and not to sell them on to third countries.
DE_097	23	In the case of the H&K rifles, however, according to the court, the German employees, together with the Mexican authorities, had deliberately provided false information.
DE_097	24	So what value do such declarations have at all?
DE_097	25	According to the Stuttgart Regional Court, at least not a major one.
DE_097	26	In addition, the German government officially admitted in 2019 that it was allowing Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, for example, to use German military equipment in the war in Yemen.
DE_097	27	If it appears politically legitimate, end-use certificates can also be officially ignored or deemed unnecessary.
DE_097	28	According to Jürgen Grässlin, the Federal Court of Justice at least signaled in its first session on Thursday that end-use certificates are a legally binding part of export licenses.
DE_097	29	"I hope that the verdict will provide absolute clarity here,"" the peace activist told nd after the hearing."
DE_097	30	The trial against H&K has clearly shown that the official mechanisms have not worked so far.
DE_097	31	A new, efficient arms export control law needs to be created here, said Grässlin.
DE_097	32	The Federal Prosecutor General also clearly demonstrated on Thursday that the illegal deliveries of the G36 assault rifles were a breach of the War Weapons Control Act, as the activist reported.
DE_097	33	This could increase the penalties for the two Group employees.
DE_097	34	However, the acquittal of the former export representative and H&K managing director is unfortunately legally binding and cannot be overturned by the BGH, according to the complainant Grässlin.
DE_097	35	The European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights had also insisted that the Group's management must take responsibility.
DE_097	36	Meanwhile, Tobias Pflüger, member of parliament for the Left Party, also emphasized the importance of the proceedings.
DE_097	37	We have a model case here on the practice and control of arms exports - a clear stance by the Federal Court of Justice would be an enormous success, the politician told nd.
DE_097	38	The MP refers to several cases in recent years in which German weapons ended up in crisis regions despite end-use certificates, for example in northern Syria.
DE_097	39	There are currently no real sanctions at EU level for violations of arms export regulations.
DE_097	40	Pflüger called for clear legal control regulations at both national and EU level.

DE_107	7	"François Ozon's film ""Grâce à Dieu"" takes on a recent scandal in the Catholic Church in France."
DE_107	8	A priest named Bernard Preynat abused dozens of children for sexual acts in Lyon.
DE_107	9	Many knew about it.
DE_107	10	Parents, relatives.
DE_107	11	And also high church officials, including a cardinal.
DE_107	12	In just under a month, a verdict will actually be announced in France.
DE_107	13	"It will be exciting to see how ""Grâce à Dieu"" is received when it is officially released in cinemas soon."
DE_107	14	The three main characters can be watched for over two hours as they emerge from their silence and organize themselves on all levels against Preynat and the Catholic Church.
DE_107	15	Scenes are strung together at an insane pace, new characters appear and fit into a web of considerable dimensions.
DE_107	16	Dirty wounds open up that the church would have preferred to seal forever with airtight plasters.
DE_107	17	"""I wanted to give the audience a tiny glimpse of the emotional and physical violence that can occur when victims share their story,"" says Ozon about his film."
DE_107	18	"In ""Grâce à Dieu"", they lead to recitations ranging from denial and relativization to ignorance and even jealousy."
DE_107	19	Who is on whose side?
DE_107	20	Can it be endured when pain also gives rise to positive energy?
DE_107	21	Fragile Men. his main concern at first would have been to make a film about male fragility.
DE_107	22	Because he would have found this rather difficult in the past.
DE_107	23	"Yet it is Melvil Poupaud - who plays Alexandre Guérin in ""Grâce à Dieu"" - who, in a way, launches the initiative ""La Parole Libérée"" (""The Broken Silence""), under whose umbrella numerous men gradually gather."
DE_107	24	"But it's true: In ""Grâce à Dieu"", more tears roll down the faces of men than in earlier works."
DE_107	25	The film is also a potpourri of facets of masculinity.
DE_107	26	"Each of the three protagonists embodies a different way of dealing with the traumatic experiences that took place in the scout camp, the photo lab or the office (Ozon stages them as silent flashbacks except for the last shot of this kind): Alexandre Guérin as an introverted, successful type with a large family and largely intact faith, François Debord (Denis Ménochet), a shirt-sleeved atheist who gives ""La Parole Libérée"" the necessary punch."
DE_107	27	"And Emmanuel Thomassin (Swann Arlaud), thanks to whom ""Grâce à Dieu"" loses some of its speed."
DE_107	28	Nevertheless, it is perhaps just the right speed to tackle this difficult issue.
DE_122	1	Who else is standing in the way of Islamist aggression?
DE_122	2	At the latest since Joe Biden's capitulation in Afghanistan, the West has ceased to be a brake on global Islamist aggression.
DE_122	3	Nevertheless, Islamism has by no means won a final victory.
DE_122	4	However, he is now confronted by forces quite different from those of the Europeans or Americans.
DE_122	5	This is now being done by more robust forces which, of course, have nothing whatsoever to do with the concept of constitutional democracy - which has never worked in the Islamic world.
DE_122	6	The West will therefore ultimately have to decide which evil it regards as the lesser.
DE_122	7	Above all, he should be aware of his own interests.
DE_122	8	He will then have to realize that although the expansion of the system of democratic constitutional states is desirable, it is not the most important thing for him.
DE_122	9	What is more important with regard to other countries is that they do not pose a threat to the outside world in any way; that they create a minimum level of political and economic stability so that no large-scale refugee movements are triggered; that no genocidal crimes take place there.
DE_122	10	If these three conditions are met, then peaceful coexistence with another state is always possible, even if there is no democracy or rule of law there.
DE_122	11	Deficits in terms of human rights will never be allowed and can never be concealed in states with freedom of expression.
DE_122	12	But the understandable desire for a zero deficit under the rule of law cannot be the ultimate guideline for our own actions.
DE_122	13	That would be imperialistic, but also absurd in view of the West's weakness.
DE_122	14	"Moreover, it is more than questionable whether the principle of a ""democratic constitutional state"" works at all in all cultures and levels of civilization."
DE_122	15	But which forces are opposing Islamism after the abdication of the USA (and Western Europe) in place of the West?
DE_122	16	Russia, China, and the moderate dictatorships in Islamic countries, especially Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
DE_122	17	None of this is a democracy.
DE_122	18	Nothing a constitutional state.
DE_122	19	You wouldn't want to live in any of these countries.
DE_122	20	Nevertheless, it should be noted: Russia and China have begun to take action against the total takeover by the Islamist Taliban of Afghanistan, which has been reeling since the US withdrawal.
DE_122	21	This is undoubtedly more than piquant.
DE_122	22	Moscow has already intervened there once (in 1980) and installed a communist regime in Afghanistan.
DE_122	23	This intervention triggered wild protests in the West at the time and even led to an Olympic boycott.
DE_122	24	As a result, the communists were fought and finally overthrown by an alliance of Taliban and local tribes, which was massively supported by the West at the time.
DE_122	25	What a difference to the present!
DE_122	26	It is unlikely that the Russians will occupy Afghanistan again.
DE_122	27	Past experience is too much of a deterrent.
DE_122	28	But they certainly want to protect the neighboring Central Asian (and ex-Soviet) states such as Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan against an advance by the Taliban.
DE_122	29	For this reason alone, they will have to support the government in Kabul, which has so far been under US patronage.
DE_122	30	This absurdly turns Moscow and Washington from bitter enemies in Afghanistan into indirect (and perhaps direct?) allies after a few decades.
DE_122	31	ally in the fight against the Taliban.
DE_122	32	Like many other peoples in Central Asia, both have now recognized that the greatest threat today is clearly posed by the Islamists.
DE_122	33	But the Chinese defense minister has also already visited Tajikistan.
DE_122	34	"Beijing shares the Russians' concerns about the ""hasty withdrawal"" of the Americans."
DE_122	35	These shared concerns represent the most unusual change in world politics.
DE_122	36	Who could ever have imagined in recent decades that the Russians and Chinese could be jointly concerned about an American military withdrawal?
DE_122	37	They both know that the situation in that region is much more important to them than it is to the Americans.
DE_122	38	However, both countries also have major problems with Islamic minorities on their own territory, from the Chechens to the Uyghurs.

DE_125	2	One week after the military took power in Chad, resistance is stirring.
DE_125	3	At least five people were killed on Tuesday during the suppression of demonstrations against the new military regime.
DE_125	4	According to official figures, four people died in the capital Ndjamena and one in the town of Moundou in the south of the country.
DE_125	5	A woman killed by demonstrators was among the dead in Ndjamena, the public prosecutor's office said in the evening.
DE_125	6	The demonstrators were unable to form larger gatherings; even small gatherings of people were broken up by force, eyewitnesses reported.
DE_125	7	The independent human rights organization CTDDH (Chadian Convention for the Defense of Human Rights) counted nine dead, seven of them in the capital and two in Moundou, as well as 16 injured.
DE_125	8	A 19-year-old was killed in Ndjamena by a police shot to the stomach, and police also shot people in Moundou.
DE_125	9	"It was a ""disproportionate use of weapons of war against an unarmed population"", the CTDDH said in a statement."
DE_125	10	Opposition groups announced new protests for Wednesday.
DE_125	11	Chad has been governed by a military council since Tuesday last week, after long-time President Idriss Déby was killed during a visit to the front against rebels who had moved in from Libya.
DE_125	12	His son Mahamat Idriss Déby is now president at the head of a military council for a renewable period of 18 months.
DE_125	13	"Marcon condemns ""repression"" This contradicts the Chadian constitution, according to which the death of the president means that the speaker of parliament takes over his office and new elections are held after 90 days at the latest, and is therefore rejected by the civilian and military opposition."
DE_125	14	"Mahamat Idriss Déby announced an ""inclusive national dialog"" in a televised speech on Tuesday evening and received representatives of political parties for talks."
DE_125	15	The African Union (AU) announced a mediation mission in Chad.
DE_125	16	Chad's new ruler initially saw himself vindicated by the fact that numerous presidents, including Emmanuel Macron from France, had traveled to Ndjamena on Friday for the funeral service for his father, who was killed, and met with him for talks.
DE_125	17	"But on Wednesday night, Macron condemned the ""repression"" against the demonstrators and called for a ""peaceful, democratic and inclusive"" transition."
DE_125	18	Ndjamena is home to one of France's most important foreign military bases, from which the anti-terrorist campaign in the Sahel region is commanded.
DE_125	19	That is why France has a great interest in stability in Chad.
DE_125	20	It is still unclear whether Chad's various rebel groups will carry out their threat and march on the capital to overthrow Mahamat Idriss Déby.
DE_125	21	According to reports, the rebels of the FACT (Front for Change and Concord in Chad), who marched in from Libya and against whom Idriss Déby was killed in action, have now become the target of French air strikes.

DE_159	1	New risks of the networked world
DE_159	2	At the Berlin Court of Appeal, the staff of the highest criminal and civil court in the German capital have to communicate by fax, paper and telephone these days.
DE_159	3	The email system of the Court of Appeal was infected by the notorious Emotet malware, a Trojan that the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) recently warned German companies about.
DE_159	4	Emotet is initially designed to spy on infected e-mail systems.
DE_159	5	The program can then download further malware - for example, banking Trojans that attempt to divert digital cash flows into the pockets of cyber criminals.
DE_159	6	Other malware programs are primarily aimed at blackmailing victims.
DE_159	7	In these ransomware attacks, manipulated emails are also used to encourage users to click on an infected file attachment and thus trigger a comprehensive encryption of all data on the computers in the network.
DE_159	8	A ransom is demanded for the password with which the data can be decrypted.
DE_159	9	"Waves of attacks with Trojans ""WannaCry"" and ""NotPetya"" Hardly a week goes by without reports of affected institutions making the rounds."
DE_159	10	"Experts have now identified well over 10,000 varieties of encryption Trojans, including the infamous ""WannaCry"", which also digitally attacked and paralyzed computers belonging to Deutsche Bahn and the city of Baltimore in the US state of Maryland."
DE_159	11	"""WannaCry"" exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Windows operating system that the US intelligence agency NSA had discovered and used for its own espionage attacks for years."
DE_159	12	"The NSA's cyber weapon called ""EternalBlue"" fell into the hands of a hacker group in 2016, after which waves of attacks with the Trojans ""WannaCry"" and ""NotPetya"" swept through the country."
DE_159	13	It is difficult to protect against the computer worms that eat their way through the networks of companies and organizations.
DE_159	14	"This is illustrated by an example reported by the renowned US security researcher Bruce Schneier at the ""Cyber Security Nordic 2019"" conference in Helsinki: ""The financial department of a casino in Las Vegas, which was actually well secured, was hacked because a fish aquarium with an internet connection was also located in the local network of the establishment."""

DE_160	1	Demonstrations - Heilbronn More and more municipalities are banning protests against corona restrictions
DE_160	2	Following the harsh criticism of the recent mass protest in Stuttgart against the coronavirus restrictions, other cities have banned registered rallies by opponents of the pandemic policy.
DE_160	3	On Friday, the administrations in Heilbronn and Rastatt cited both the risk of infection and the bad experiences with the organizers.
DE_160	4	The city of Stuttgart had previously banned two protests in order to prevent scenes like the one on Holy Saturday.
DE_160	5	"Over the Easter weekend, thousands of people took part in a rampant demonstration by the ""Querdenken"" movement without face masks or social distancing."
DE_160	6	This sparked a dispute as to whether such events could be banned.
DE_160	7	Interior Minister Thomas Strobl (CDU) expressed his understanding for the bans imposed by local authorities.
DE_160	8	"""The cities' decisions are absolutely understandable in the current situation,"" he told dpa."
DE_160	9	"""Anyone who registers a demonstration or assembly will be judged by their intentions."""
DE_160	10	"In Heilbronn, the ""lateral thinkers"" had planned to meet this Saturday (10."
DE_160	11	April).
DE_160	12	However, the city referred to the organizer's lack of commitment to accept and enforce the requirements of the public order office, such as the mask requirement.
DE_160	13	"""Experience from comparable events across the country also gives those responsible reason to doubt that the requirements will be implemented."""
DE_160	14	We are in a very critical phase of the pandemic with high incidence figures, said Lord Mayor Harry Mergel (SPD).
DE_160	15	"""It would be irresponsible to hold such an event without social distancing and compulsory masks."""
DE_160	16	A small demonstration has been authorized in Öhringen (Hohenlohe district) on Sunday.
DE_160	17	However, it is a stable group of protesters who meet regularly in a parking lot on the outskirts of the city, keep their distance and wear masks, said a city spokesperson.
DE_160	18	In Rastatt, on the other hand, opponents of the corona measures are also not welcome on Saturday.
DE_160	19	"The district administration office explained that the event, which was announced as a ""large-scale demonstration"" with around 1,000 participants, posed a significant infectious disease risk to the population."
DE_160	20	"""The subtitle of the demonstration ""Show your face for fundamental rights"" implies that the participants deliberately want to gather without masks."""
DE_160	21	However, this would contradict the measures to contain the pandemic.
DE_160	22	The health authority had weighed up the fundamental right to freedom of demonstration against the protection against infection.
DE_160	23	"""In summary, the discretionary decision is in favor of the fundamental right to life and physical integrity of third parties."""
DE_160	24	This had previously been decided differently in Stuttgart.
DE_160	25	As a result, around 15,000 people were able to gather on Holy Saturday, mostly without masks or social distancing.
DE_160	26	This is unlikely to happen again in the state capital, at least for the foreseeable future: Two of the opponents of the conditions for the 17.
DE_160	27	The city announced that demonstrations registered for April would be banned.
DE_160	28	The organizers should receive the corresponding notifications at the beginning of next week.
DE_160	29	Mayor Frank Nopper (CDU) explained the decision by saying that the applicants had previously proved to be unreliable in terms of the law on public assembly.
DE_160	30	He had previously repeatedly defended the permission for the demonstration last Saturday and referred to the right of assembly, which applies despite corona.
DE_160	31	The state Ministry of Social Affairs, on the other hand, had already insisted on a ban in advance.
DE_160	32	In the view of the authorities and legal experts, the event could have been banned during the pandemic.
DE_160	33	Observers showed a lack of understanding in view of the images from the Cannstatter Wasen.
DE_160	34	Next Monday, Nopper will have to face questions from MPs in the state parliament's Committee on Internal Affairs.
DE_160	35	"Last Saturday's demonstration was organized by representatives of the ""Querdenken"" movement."
DE_160	36	They criticize the policy to contain the coronavirus pandemic and see the measures as a restriction of fundamental rights.
DE_160	37	"Neither the ""Enough is enough"" initiative, which had registered one of the two banned protests, nor the ""lateral thinkers"" have yet commented on the ban."
DE_160	38	The State Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Baden-Württemberg is monitoring this group.
DE_160	39	"The authority assigns several actors to the ""Reichsbürger"" and ""Selbstverwalter"" milieu, which, among other things, negate democratic and constitutional structures."
DE_160	40	"The ""Querdenken"" movement rejects these accusations."
DE_161	1	Czech Republic: The strong interests of Mr. Babiš
DE_161	2	On Thursday evening, they protested in several Czech cities against Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, against the Minister of Justice and against their president.
DE_161	3	"Access only with FFP-2 mask, negative test, disinfected hands - the organization behind the demonstrations, ""One Million Moments"", had also fought for good pandemic management from the very beginning. In 2019, it brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets; the reasons for this have not diminished since then."
DE_161	4	The latest cause for concern is the resignation of Attorney General Pavel Zeman a week ago, his reason: too much pressure from above.
DE_161	5	The 48-year-old is held in high regard and is considered to have integrity and independence.
DE_161	6	"He had arranged for an investigation to continue against Prime Minister Babiš in the case of alleged EU subsidy fraud in the construction of the ""Stork's Nest"" congress center."
DE_161	7	The demonstrators fear that Pavel Zeman could be succeeded by someone who is more sympathetic to the prime minister.
DE_161	8	They see the justice minister, prime minister and president all in cahoots.
DE_161	9	"""Czech justice should not stink from the head down,"" reads the poster of a demonstrator on Wenceslas Square in Prague."
DE_161	10	Others call Babiš a liar and a thief.
DE_161	11	The demonstrators may feel encouraged by the EU Parliament.
DE_161	12	In a meeting on Wednesday, MEPs from various political groups called on the EU Commission and Council to finally take action in the Czech Republic's case.
DE_161	13	As with Poland and Hungary, the new rule of law mechanism must be applied here as soon as possible.
DE_161	14	After years of work, the European Commission finally established this in April: Andrej Babiš is in a conflict of interest.
DE_161	15	According to the report, the wealthy company founder still exerts a decisive influence over Agrofert Holding, which also operates companies in Germany, including Lieken Urkorn and Golden Toast.
DE_161	16	Babiš appropriated parts of the state and its institutions.
DE_161	17	In concrete terms, this means that Agrofert may not receive any EU subsidies as long as the prime minister decides on the distribution of subsidies in his country or is involved in negotiations on the EU budget and procurement directives.
DE_161	18	As early as December 2018, when it became known that the Commission assumed a conflict of interest, the then Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger made it clear: Babiš must either sell his companies, resign from office or Agrofert must no longer receive any subsidies.
DE_161	19	So much for the theory.
DE_161	20	Practically nothing happened.
DE_161	21	After all the excitement surrounding the case, everything seemed to fizzle out when the report was finally delivered in April.
DE_161	22	The EU stated that European taxpayers had not been harmed; the Czech Republic did not have to pay anything back, file cover closed.
DE_161	23	Nevertheless, money from public coffers has flowed in.
DE_161	24	But it is the Czech taxpayers alone who have to foot the bill.
DE_161	25	The Czech Republic had withdrawn all project applications for which the EU would not have paid anything due to the identified conflict of interest.
DE_161	26	For Monika Hohlmeier (CSU), Chair of the Budgetary Control Committee, this is not the end of the matter.
DE_161	27	"When projects are withdrawn ""after the Commission or the European Court of Auditors have pointed out irregularities"", it seems to her ""almost like an attempt at a cover-up""."
DE_161	28	"Unjustly paid subsidies must be repaid, she demands, ""regardless of whether they are EU funds or national funds""."
DE_161	29	"The Green Party's Viola von Cramon said in plenary that Babiš and Agrofert had appropriated ""parts of the Czech state and its institutions""."
DE_161	30	"Are the Council and Commission really willing to ""tolerate this oligarchization of a member state?"""
DE_161	31	Confidence in the EU has grown.
DE_161	32	The Budgetary Control Committee is preparing a resolution to be voted on in June.
DE_161	33	Broad support across all political groups and nations can be assumed.
DE_161	34	The EU has so far discontinued payments from the Structural Funds.
DE_161	35	However, tens of millions of euros continue to flow into the Czech Republic every year from the agricultural fund.
DE_161	36	The parliamentarians are demanding clarification from the Commission as to who exactly receives the area premiums.
DE_161	37	Andrej Babiš and his minority government have been counted out.
DE_161	38	They are losing rapidly in voter polls, mainly but not solely due to their poor handling of the pandemic.
DE_161	39	According to the Eurobarometer, nowhere in the EU is trust in their own government lower at the moment - but the Czechs' trust in the EU has grown significantly.
DE_164	1	Planned kidnapping of Karl Lauterbach: ringleader arrested
DE_164	2	A group of Reich citizens is said to have planned to kidnap Karl Lauterbach.
DE_164	3	The police report the arrest of the ringleader.
DE_164	4	Update from 13.
DE_164	5	October 2022, 11.10 a.m.: The police report the arrest of the leader of a group planning to kidnap Karl Lauterbach.
DE_164	6	This was reported by the AFP news agency, citing information from the police.
DE_164	7	They had succeeded in arresting Elisabeth R. in Central Saxony.
DE_164	8	She is said to have been the ringleader of a group that tried to kidnap the Federal Minister of Health in April of this year.
DE_164	9	The woman is said to be a member of the Reichsbürger group.
DE_164	10	This was reported by the news portal t-online, citing the Federal Public Prosecutor General.
DE_164	11	A group of Reich citizens is said to have planned to kidnap Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach. Bernd von Jutrczenka/dpa Karl Lauterbach: Planned kidnapping - police investigate.
DE_164	12	"Update from Friday, 15.04.2022, 08.45 a.m.: In view of the abduction plans against Karl Lauterbach by people from the ""Querdenken"" and Reichsbürger scene that have come to light, Saskia Esken has called for tough action by the security authorities."
DE_164	13	"""The current findings about the foiled kidnapping of Karl Lauterbach and other attacks in Germany are once again alarming,"" the SPD leader* told Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland on Friday."
DE_164	14	"""The radicalization of so-called lateral thinkers or the Reichsbürger scene is taking on frightening proportions and is deeply worrying,"" said Esken."
DE_164	15	"She referred to an action plan by Interior Minister Nancy Faeser* (SPD), which focuses on prevention and ""consistent toughness"" by the security authorities."
DE_164	16	"The investigations into the planned kidnapping of Karl Lauterbach revealed an ""abyss"" and showed a ""serious terrorist threat"", explained Federal Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser on Thursday (14.04.2022)."
DE_164	17	Armed Reichsbürger and radicalized corona deniers are united by a boundless hatred of democracy, the state and people who stand up for the community.
DE_164	18	The kidnapping plans and the fantasies of overthrow showed a new quality of threat.
DE_164	19	"""Highly dangerous"": Lauterbach reacts to abduction plans by ""lateral thinkers"" +++ 1.45 p.m.: Karl Lauterbach reacted on Thursday afternoon to the investigations by the Koblenz public prosecutor's office into plans for an attack by right-wing extremists."
DE_164	20	Lauterbach said on Thursday during an appointment in Husum that the incident would not affect him in his work.
DE_164	21	"""I will carry on as before."""
DE_164	22	The process shows that the coronavirus protests have become radicalized.
DE_164	23	This is no longer just about corona, but also about the attempt to destabilize the state.
DE_164	24	"These forces are a small but ""highly dangerous"" minority in society."
DE_164	25	"Lauterbach said that the coronavirus policy could be debated on the merits - ""but violence is never an option""."
DE_164	26	"Karl Lauterbach: People from the ""lateral thinking"" scene allegedly planned kidnapping."
DE_164	27	"Initial report from Thursday, 14.04.2022, 10.30 a.m.: Berlin - Twelve men and women from the ""Querdenken"" and Reichsbürger scene are said to have planned to kidnap the Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach *."
DE_164	28	"This was reported by the ARD magazine* ""Report Mainz""."
DE_164	29	"They apparently wanted to ""eliminate"" Lauterbach's bodyguards."
DE_164	30	Explosive attacks on power lines and substations were also planned.
DE_164	31	According to a statement, the Koblenz public prosecutor's office is now investigating the twelve people on suspicion of serious acts of violence endangering the state.
DE_164	32	Four suspects have already been arrested.
DE_164	33	"According to the report, the aim was to bring about ""civil war-like conditions"" ""and ultimately to overthrow the democratic system in Germany""."
DE_164	34	Right-wing extremists planned attacks on infrastructure.
DE_164	35	"The suspects apparently organized themselves in a chat group called ""United Patriots""."
DE_164	36	During searches, the investigating authorities have already found and confiscated ammunition, weapons, cash and gold bars as well as forged coronavirus vaccination and test certificates.
DE_164	37	Detailed files on the attack plans were also discovered.
DE_186	1	Scary festival etiquette: Halloween: when does a prank become a crime?
DE_186	2	For horror fans all over Germany, the 31.
DE_186	3	October is a special day.
DE_186	4	Halloween is all about sweets, children dressed up and often pranks.
DE_186	5	"But so-called ""Halloween pranks"" in particular often operate in a legal gray area. stern explains what is allowed - and when a line is crossed."
DE_186	6	October 31 is a kind of holiday for many horror fans and dress-up artists.
DE_186	7	For the police, however, Halloween is a day of heightened alert.
DE_186	8	"Beyond the harmless children's cry of ""Trick or treat"", some people feel called upon to go over the top on Halloween."
DE_186	9	However, the same rules apply on October 31 as elsewhere - anyone who breaks the law must expect to be punished.
DE_186	10	What is problematic about Halloween?
DE_186	11	In recent years, there have been a number of incidents around Halloween in which the fun of being spooky turned into damage to property, acts of violence or coercion.
DE_186	12	The phenomenon of horror clowns causing fear and terror that had emerged in the meantime did subside.
DE_186	13	But a drunk man in a clown mask has just caused a police operation at Munich Airport by threatening passers-by.
DE_186	14	The police are particularly vigilant in large cities.
DE_186	15	"Anyone who scrounges for sweets with ""Trick or treat"" can do so, but without being able to insist on getting them."
DE_186	16	The sweet should be given voluntarily and gladly - the sour should remain an empty, joking threat.
DE_186	17	What are the typical offenses?
DE_186	18	Eggs thrown at house walls and cars, garbage cans knocked over, letterboxes demolished, fireworks thrown at windows or graffiti especially on Halloween - the list of alleged pranks reported to the police is long throughout Germany.
DE_186	19	A special phenomenon from various large cities are groups that deliberately seek out and provoke fights, especially around train stations, or even target people with fireworks.
DE_186	20	All these offenses have one thing in common: they are prohibited and therefore punishable.
DE_186	21	What are the penalties?
DE_186	22	The police are stepping up checks nationwide.
DE_186	23	Anyone caught causing damage to property, for example, could face a fine or up to two years in prison.
DE_186	24	You could even face up to three years in prison for what is known as criminal damage to property.
DE_186	25	These are items for public use such as park benches.
DE_186	26	In a group, those who do not cause damage themselves can also be punished.
DE_186	27	They face penalties for joint damage to property.
DE_186	28	Are children allowed to go out on their own?
DE_186	29	Here too, Halloween does not suspend the rules - in this case the duty of supervision.
DE_186	30	With smaller children at least, an adult should be present during the candy hunt and at least keep a watchful eye on their children.
DE_186	31	In principle, parents should also make their children aware of the pranks and discourage them from damaging property and committing other crimes.
DE_186	32	Adults should also encourage them not to participate in acts that are forbidden due to peer pressure.
DE_186	33	Who compensates for damage?
DE_186	34	If the perpetrator of damage to property or bodily injury is identified, they must pay for the damage.
DE_186	35	Otherwise, homeowners' insurance can at least partially compensate those affected by willful damage.
DE_186	36	The children dress up, the father drives them from house to house wearing a horror mask: what fits the scene can also end with a fine for the driver.
DE_186	37	For two years now, it has been illegal to cover your face while driving - offenders are fined 60 euros.
DE_186	38	Drinking and driving should be taboo anyway.
DE_187	1	Roman Protasevich: He fell out with Alexander Lukashenko as a teenager
DE_187	2	Roman Protasevich turns the Belarus regime against himself.
DE_187	3	But who is the young blogger who is putting so much pressure on ruler Alexander Lukashenko?
DE_187	4	At the age of 17, the then young journalist ran two groups critical of Lukashenko on the Russian online network Vkontakte and was therefore arrested in Belarus for several hours and, according to his own account, mistreated.
DE_187	5	"They kicked me in the kidney and liver,"" he reported at the time."
DE_187	6	I had blood in my urine for three days afterwards.
DE_187	7	"They threatened to charge me with unsolved murders."""
DE_187	8	During the interrogations, the officers of the Belarusian secret service, which is still called the KGB today as it was in Soviet times, demanded the passwords to the online groups.
DE_187	9	"One of these groups was called ""We are fed up with this Lukashenko""."
DE_187	10	He only knows this president - because Lukashenko has been in power in Belarus since 1994, one year before Protasevich was born.
DE_187	11	The young opposition activist stayed in his home country for the time being, worked as a photographer for Belarusian media and received a scholarship for aspiring independent journalists in 2017-2018. In 2019, he went into exile in Poland and Lithuania shortly after he started working for the influential opposition Telegram channel Nexta.
DE_187	12	In the meantime, he also became editor-in-chief there.
DE_187	13	Roman Protasevich: Fled from Belarus into exile in Poland out of fear of Alexander Lukashenko.
DE_187	14	For Nexta, the 26-year-old reported on the presidential election last August, in which opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya challenged Lukashenko.
DE_187	15	When the incumbent declared himself the winner after the election, which was overshadowed by allegations of fraud, there were unprecedented mass protests.
DE_187	16	The Nexta channel, which currently has more than 1.2 million readers, played an important role in this: it provided its subscribers with dates and times of the protests.
DE_187	17	Nexta.
DE_187	18	This is a widespread Russian-language Telegram channel on the political situation in Belarus.
DE_187	19	The autocratic regime of ruler Alexander Lukashenko is clearly criticized and tackled in the articles.
DE_187	20	According to Bild, the Telegram service had more than 2.1 million readers at times - and therefore had a corresponding influence.
DE_187	21	Roman Protasevich co-founded the online news service and was its editor-in-chief for a time.
DE_187	22	He increasingly became the focus of the autocratic regime: Lukashenko had an arrest warrant issued for Protasevich in November.
DE_187	23	"His work for Nexta implicated him in a terrorist activity,"" was the reason given."
DE_187	24	"Protasewitsch, who is now an editor at the BGM channel with 260,000 subscribers, jokingly describes himself on his Twitter profile as the ""first terror journalist in history""."
DE_187	25	However, accusations of terrorism can result in the death penalty in Belarus - and this is actually still carried out in the Eastern European country.
DE_187	26	Roman Protasevich: Alexander Lukashenko had regime critic arrested in Ryanair incident.
DE_187	27	Until Pentecost 2021: In an internationally sensational action, Lukashenko personally ordered a Ryanair plane to be diverted to Minsk by a fighter jet, which was originally en route from Greece to Lithuania.
DE_187	28	On board: regime critic Roman Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
DE_187	29	Both were arrested after the forced emergency landing in Minsk.
DE_191	1	Quit when it's at its best
DE_191	2	It's uncomfortable outside.
DE_191	3	The snow is falling, paths and roads are slippery.
DE_191	4	And yet the door to the Rothenburg City Library opens again and again.
DE_191	5	A young man swaps fairy tales and reading books for his children.
DE_191	6	By the kilo.
DE_191	7	"""They are so beautiful."
DE_191	8	And quickly read out.
DE_191	9	"We need regular supplies,"" laughs the Rothenburg native."
DE_191	10	A drop of bitterness mingles with his good mood.
DE_191	11	From the new year onwards, the family will no longer receive their reading material from Eveline Neumann.
DE_191	12	She stops due to her age.
DE_191	13	"""With a heavy heart"", as she says."
DE_191	14	The 65-year-old has provided generations of Rothenburg residents with interesting books, introducing them to stories, genres, certain topics, but also to local history.
DE_191	15	"""Evi"" was the ""good spirit"" here for 32 years."
DE_191	16	She knew the people in the city, the people knew her.
DE_191	17	That's why visits to the library were often like family reunions.
DE_191	18	People exchanged ideas - not only about acquaintances, but also about city politics and much more.
DE_191	19	Many gifts for the library director.
DE_191	20	Heike Petzelt is just coming by for a chat.
DE_191	21	And, of course, brings along the obligatory bag full of books he has read.
DE_191	22	When she thinks of Eveline Neumann's departure, she is grateful and sad at the same time.
DE_191	23	"""'Evi' always had an open ear."
DE_191	24	"She was competent in her job, but also focused on people and their problems."""
DE_191	25	For example with the punctual returns.
DE_191	26	"""She was really very accommodating,"" smiles the Rothenburg resident."
DE_191	27	"Meanwhile, a cry for help can be heard from the back rows of shelves: ""Have you got a pair of reading glasses?"""
DE_191	28	Eveline Neumann has, but the visual acuity of the two women is too different.
DE_191	29	Never mind.
DE_191	30	Before the reader leaves the library - with new books, of course - she gives the outgoing manager a present.
DE_191	31	In the meantime, many gifts have arrived on the shelf behind her desk - a sign of how much the people in the city like their library director.
DE_191	32	"That's not the only reason why ""Evi"" gets misty-eyed when she talks."
DE_191	33	"""I really enjoyed doing this work."
DE_191	34	"It wasn't just a job you had to do to earn money."""
DE_191	35	She was probably born with a love of books, says the Rothenburg native.
DE_191	36	"""We always read in our family, we were never bored."""
DE_191	37	Despite this, she first studied civil engineering and worked as a construction manager in her home town and the surrounding area for twelve years.
DE_191	38	After the political change, she took the opportunity to reorient herself professionally.
DE_191	39	"From January 1991, she was employed by the town of Rothenburg and trained as an ""Assistant for Public Libraries"" while working."
DE_191	40	There was also great support from colleagues at the Niesky library during this time.
DE_191	41	"""I immediately realized - this is my thing,"" recalls Eveline Neumann."
DE_191	42	"""The symbiosis of books and people - that's what I've always wanted."""
DE_191	43	Around 500 titles are exchanged every year.
DE_191	44	In Rothenburg, she manages a stock of around 12,000 books.
DE_191	45	"""In the beginning, we only had GDR literature."
DE_191	46	This had to be viewed and supplemented.
DE_191	47	The building was also pretty run-down at the time.
DE_191	48	That's why we started lending on the upper floor.
DE_191	49	"The rooms downstairs were not usable at all."""
DE_191	50	Many volumes found their way from Rothenburg ob der Tauber to the city on the Neisse in the 1990s.
DE_191	51	To this day, the connection to the twin town has not been broken, especially on a personal level.
DE_191	52	The selection of new acquisitions was not easy back then.
DE_191	53	"""After reunification, we were literally flooded with books - colorful, beautiful, but also with a lot of empty content."""
DE_191	54	Of course, Eveline Neumann now knows what the Rothenburg bookworms like best.
DE_191	55	Children's books for all ages are very popular.
DE_191	56	But also crime novels and contemporary literature - which she also likes herself.
DE_191	57	Plus science fiction and fantasy.
DE_191	58	"Personally, she is currently reading Lukas Rietzschel's ""Mit der Faust in die Welt schlagen""."
DE_191	59	In it, the author from Görlitz writes about the radicalization of young people in Upper Lusatia.
DE_191	60	Around 500 titles are replaced in the Rothenburg City Library's collection every year.
DE_191	61	"""Of course, I can't put them all on my bedside table,"" smiles the librarian."
DE_191	62	Future focus on painting, traveling and nature.
DE_191	63	She knew that her dream job would come to an end at some point.

DE_196	1	Bishop Overbeck on the war in Ukraine: justice must prevail
DE_196	2	Franz-Josef Overbeck (58) has been Bishop of Essen for almost exactly 13 years - and times have rarely been more challenging for the Ruhr bishop than they are today.
DE_196	3	The Catholic Church is caught up in the storm of abuse scandals, war is raging in Europe, inflation and the exploding cost of living are depriving many people in the Ruhr region of sleep.
DE_196	4	In these difficult times, the church could provide support and orientation, but it also has a lot to do with itself at the moment.
DE_196	5	"In the fifth episode of the WAZ video talk with editor-in-chief Andreas Tyrock entitled ""Ruhrgebiet, wir müssen reden!"
DE_196	6	""" the Ruhr bishop found clear words for the injustice of the Russian war of aggression, for the church's reform efforts and for the concerns of the people in the Ruhr region."
DE_196	7	Building peace without weapons.
DE_196	8	"""Creating peace without weapons"", this slogan from the times of the peace movement, has lost its meaning in view of the war in Ukraine, said Overbeck, who is also the military bishop of the Bundeswehr and therefore the highest pastor of all Catholic soldiers."
DE_196	9	"It was not just an armed conflict, ""but a war between systems and ideas""."
DE_196	10	With Ukraine, a state based on democratic principles is defending itself against a violent Russian regime.
DE_196	11	"""This is about defending the law against the might of the strongest,"" emphasized Overbeck."
DE_196	12	"""And here I am quite resolute: The law must prevail."""
DE_196	13	Overbeck admits that this conflict can only be won through violence, which causes countless deaths and endless suffering, and that this brings many Christians into conflicts of conscience and is almost unbearable.
DE_196	14	But in view of the fundamental nature of the dispute, the fight is necessary.
DE_196	15	"Nevertheless, the church cannot speak of a ""just war""."
DE_196	16	"Rather, it was about achieving a ""just peace"", which could mean having to use force as a last resort."
DE_196	17	It was therefore necessary to support the country under attack with arms supplies, said the military bishop, referring to the political debate.
DE_196	18	In his conversations with soldiers, he says he is experiencing growing psychological stress in the face of the war.
DE_196	19	"""For the first time, they are facing the possibility of a military conflict that many thought would never happen."" This fills many members of the Bundeswehr, but above all their families, with great uncertainty and fear."
DE_196	20	"""It's a bitter arrival in reality, which I also wish was more peaceful."" Fears among the population."
DE_196	21	He also recognizes increasing fears among the population in the Ruhr region, not only because of the war, but also because of the growing economic and social insecurity.
DE_196	22	In these times of crisis, the church has the task of arguing with reason and being a reliable partner for people and supporting them with its charitable institutions.
DE_196	23	"""It always moves me to see how supportive the people here are."""
DE_196	24	Nevertheless, people's trust in the church has been deeply shaken by the abuse scandals, and more and more believers have turned away from the church in recent years.
DE_196	25	With 9133 people leaving the church, the diocese set a new negative record last year.
DE_196	26	Overbeck knows that this is the result of great disappointment and the growing loss of trust that the church has had to accept due to its handling of the abuse.
DE_200	1	Short and the agony of choice
DE_200	2	In Austria, the governing coalition of the ÖVP and FPÖ is - once again - history.
DE_200	3	For the time being.
DE_200	4	Federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz wants new elections as soon as possible.
DE_200	5	A cut that is unavoidable after the admission of guilt and resignation of FPÖ leader Heinz Christian Strache.
DE_200	6	Eight days before the EU parliamentary elections, the country has been turned upside down.
DE_200	7	But the vote of the people is still pending.
DE_200	8	A secretly recorded video was Strache's undoing.
DE_200	9	The statements made by the FPÖ leader on the boozy evening shown in the video cannot be justified morally or politically.
DE_200	10	"That is why Kurz also says: ""Enough is enough""."
DE_200	11	Strache has drawn the consequences.
DE_200	12	His party is out of the game with him.
DE_200	13	Federal President van der Bellen will be delighted to call the new elections.
DE_200	14	But there are question marks.
DE_200	15	Question marks that point far beyond the mixed situation in small Austria.
DE_200	16	Forget the good government work that Berlin can only dream of.
DE_200	17	The fervor with which German politicians are commenting on the case is astonishing.
DE_200	18	"""Enemies of freedom"", they say, who have finally been hunted down."
DE_200	19	In the front row, Chancellor Angela Merkel, who breaks the baton over the FPÖ's blue party immediately after Sebastian Kurz's statement.
DE_200	20	They are venal, they have a pact with Russia, they are corrupt and cynical, they want to crush minorities and destroy the European Union.
DE_200	21	Get rid of it!
DE_200	22	Wait a minute!
DE_200	23	Don't we have European elections in eight days?
DE_200	24	Isn't Strache one of the heads of the alliance of right-wing nationalist parties across the continent, which are predicted to be very successful in the elections?
DE_200	25	Was the video not published by the German media?
DE_200	26	What is this sudden burning interest in the small Alpine republic?
DE_200	27	The good government work of the unequal Kurz-Strache team seems to have been forgotten.
DE_200	28	Yes, the two of them have slaughtered sacred cows.
DE_200	29	Border protection required.
DE_200	30	Social benefits curbed.
DE_200	31	Taxes on labor reduced.
DE_200	32	integration of immigrants to a reasonable level.
DE_200	33	Putting the interests of one's own country first.
DE_200	34	The grand coalition in Berlin can only dream of all this.
DE_200	35	Merkel knows that.
DE_200	36	She knows that the AfD is hot on her heels.
DE_200	37	And that an alliance between Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini, Strache and friends in this European election can usher in a turning point that will shake Germany out of its false dreams.
DE_200	38	The people will not vote for the left.
DE_200	39	In a word: the background to this shameful video has yet to be fully clarified.
DE_200	40	In the meantime, however, no one has yet done the math with the people.
DE_200	41	"Although the 10,000 people on Vienna's Ballhausplatz are being invoked like a tantra by the public broadcaster ORF, the ""silent"" majority of people in Austria and Germany will form their own opinions on the dramatic events."
DE_200	42	People will say, what would happen if we judged everyone by what they say when they're drunk on private evenings?
DE_200	43	Who has the interest in planting a devious video as a bomb two years later?
DE_200	44	Who wants to bully and weaken Austria and with it the entire right-wing conservative camp in Europe?
DE_200	45	Chancellor Kurz was increasingly unhappy with his partner and is now newly divorced.
DE_200	46	He wants to try again, and he will succeed.
DE_200	47	But the people will not vote for the left.
DE_200	48	Not in Austria, not in Europe.
DE_200	49	The response to the great manipulation in both Europe and Austria is likely to be clearer than Angela Merkel would like.
DE_213	1	Comment: GroKo balance sheet - so easy and yet so difficult
DE_213	2	A mid-term review of the Grand Coalition can be quite simple - if you only take a systematic look, as in a recent study, at which projects and promises have already been implemented and which have not.
DE_213	3	List debits and credits, calculate percentages, check the box.
DE_213	4	The balance sheet that the federal government wants to present by mid-October will probably be similar.
DE_213	5	However, a GroKo mid-term review can also be infinitely complicated: Namely when you have to evaluate it politically beyond individual projects and percentages.
DE_213	6	Which brings us to the parties behind this grand coalition.
DE_213	7	"It would be a mistake to completely disregard the CDU/CSU when it comes to the question of ""to continue or not to continue""; here, too, there is GroKo fatigue in some quarters."
DE_213	8	But for the SPD, the issue is far more pressing.
DE_213	9	She will be the one who will cause this coalition to collapse - or not.
DE_213	10	Where does the SPD want to go?
DE_213	11	The SPD grassroots rightly expect more from their party leadership than a simple debit and credit calculation: political accounting alone is not enough to answer the question of whether the grand coalition should remain in power.
DE_213	12	"Because even if the ""to do"" pile is higher than the to-do list is long, even if there are still good solutions for the basic pension and climate protection in the coming weeks, which is anything but guaranteed, one thing cannot be argued away: In the public perception, the positive side of the GroKo balance sheet is not getting through, citizens no longer trust this coalition."
DE_213	13	And in the SPD, which has been hit particularly hard by this crisis of confidence, the candidates for the party chairmanship must now give an answer as to where they want to go.
DE_213	14	Those who have long since decided to leave have it easy.
DE_213	15	For others, the matter is trickier, as they actually wanted to wait for the government's mid-term review before making their own recommendation to stay or leave.
DE_213	16	An egg dance instead of a clear edge.
DE_213	17	However, the government's balance sheet will not be presented until after the SPD's presentation conferences are over.
DE_213	18	So we can probably expect a lot of verbal wrangling.
DE_213	19	The provisional SPD party leadership is trying to play down the GroKo issue - it is only one of many aspects in the search for a new leader.
DE_213	20	I think she's wrong about that.
DE_213	21	This is a fundamental issue that will play a central role in the decision of the grassroots comrades.
DE_213	22	We are talking about the mid-term review of the grand coalition, but there are actually at least three reviews.
DE_213	23	The first will come from the government in mid-October, the second from the SPD members when they decide which party leadership and course they want.
DE_213	24	"And the third assessment will not take place until the beginning of December at the SPD federal party conference, when the delegates say ""Hop or topp GroKo""."
DE_213	25	Only then is the final calculation really made.
DE_213	26	Until then, we can only speculate - the SPD is always good for surprises.
DE_224	1	Architect of the controversial pension reform in France resigns - Truckers lay down highways...
DE_224	2	The architect of the controversial pension reform in France has resigned: Jean-Paul Delevoye has been dismissed as High Commissioner for Pension Reform at his own request by President Emmanuel Macron, the Elysée Palace announced in Paris on Monday.
DE_224	3	The 72-year-old had not officially declared various paid and unpaid activities and mandates.
DE_224	4	He was therefore accused of having a conflict of interest with his government office.
DE_224	5	"Macron accepted the resignation ""with regret"", according to the Elysée Palace."
DE_224	6	Delevoye will be replaced shortly.
DE_224	7	Macron appointed the conservative politician in September 2017 to work on the pension reform.
DE_224	8	It is one of the head of state's key campaign promises.
DE_224	9	Strikes against the pension reform are taking place in France for the twelfth day in a row.
DE_224	10	It provides for French people to be able to retire without deductions at the age of 64 instead of 62.
DE_224	11	In addition, preferential pensions are to be abolished, for example for rail and Paris public transport.
DE_224	12	"Delevoye justified his resignation with the ""weakened trust"" in his person."
DE_224	13	"He described himself as a victim of ""violent attacks and a mixture of lies""."
DE_224	14	"This is detrimental to the pension reform, which is ""essential for France""."
DE_224	15	Truck drivers cause hundreds of kilometers of traffic jams.
DE_224	16	On Monday, truck drivers also responded to a trade union appeal for the first time.
DE_224	17	"With ""snail's pace"" actions, they caused traffic disruptions on national roads and highways around cities such as Strasbourg, Lyon and Toulouse."
DE_224	18	The truck drivers and other employees in the logistics sector want to achieve higher wages and better working conditions.
DE_224	19	In Marseille and Lens, workers blocked the entrances to logistics centers.
DE_224	20	The truck drivers also wanted to paralyze French toll booths.
DE_224	21	There were also blockades in the greater Paris area.
DE_224	22	In the French capital, a demonstration by transport workers was planned for later in the day.
DE_224	23	Local transport strikes continue.
DE_224	24	The truck drivers' actions exacerbated the situation for many commuters, who are facing their twelfth consecutive day of strikes on the railroads and local Paris transport.
DE_224	25	In the meantime, traffic jams totaling almost 630 kilometers in length formed around Paris.
DE_224	26	Many trains across the country did not run, and most metros in Paris were also at a standstill again.
DE_224	27	The trade unions have called for nationwide demonstrations against the government's pension reform plans on Tuesday.
DE_224	28	The government once again appealed to the strikers to refrain from taking action over the Christmas period.
DE_224	29	However, a rapprochement is not yet in sight.
DE_224	30	According to the government's plans, French people will only be able to retire without deductions at the age of 64 instead of 62.
DE_232	1	New green goals
DE_232	2	Deutsche Bank wants to catch up on climate and environmental protection and achieve its sustainability targets earlier.
DE_232	3	The bank plans to achieve more than 200 billion euros in sustainable financing and investments by the end of 2023 - two years earlier than initially announced.
DE_232	4	"""We need to move from ambition to impact as quickly as possible,"" said Group CEO Christian Sewing at a Group sustainability event on Thursday."
DE_232	5	Since the announcement of the 200 billion target, the bank has made much better progress than expected.
DE_232	6	At the end of the first quarter, Deutsche Bank's sustainable financing and capital investments amounted to 71 billion euros, said Sewing.
DE_232	7	In the middle of last year, the bank set itself the target of increasing the volume of sustainable financing and the portfolio of assets under management in investments that meet criteria such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) to a total of more than EUR 200 billion by the end of 2025.
DE_232	8	Of the targeted total volume by 2023, EUR 86 billion is now to be allocated to the Private Clients Bank, EUR 30 billion to the Corporate Bank and EUR 105 billion to the Investment Bank.
DE_232	9	ESG offerings are to become standard in all business areas.
DE_232	10	A few years ago, ESG was still considered a decorative accessory, but the topic has long since spread to all areas of the financial market.
DE_232	11	As the heart of the capital markets, banks are at least as important as industrial groups in terms of their influence on climate change.
DE_232	12	According to ECB banking supervision, financial institutions in the eurozone will soon have to take greater account of climate change risks in their business.
DE_232	13	However, an institution such as Deutsche Bank is faced with the dilemma that it urgently needs income in order to achieve its profit targets in view of the continuing high costs.
DE_232	14	This makes it more difficult to operate responsibly.
DE_232	15	On the other hand, money can now also be made with ESG: Banks arrange special bonds, for example, whose interest rate depends on whether companies meet their sustainability targets.
DE_232	16	At the same time, investors are demanding more and more ESG investment products.
DE_232	17	However, the plans do not go far enough for non-governmental organizations.
DE_232	18	"""Deutsche Bank is making an elephant out of a fly,"" said Magdalena Senn, an expert in sustainable finance at the Finanzwende association."
DE_232	19	The announced 200 billion euros in sustainable financing by 2023 amounted to just 15 percent of the bank's current balance sheet total.
DE_232	20	"""That is unambitious."
DE_232	21	In view of an economy in transition, it is rather surprising that Deutsche Bank is not already financing more sustainable projects.
DE_232	22	In fact, banks such as the French BNP Paribas are already much further ahead than the Frankfurt-based banks, and international institutions such as JP Morgan have long since overtaken them.
DE_232	23	"""Deutsche Bank is not doing justice to the climate crisis with this window-dressing"" ""Deutsche Bank wants to gradually move away from coal as an energy source,"" says Thomas Küchenmeister from Facing Finance, an organization critical of banks."
DE_232	24	However, the bank still allows many exceptions and overall presents an under-ambitious picture.
DE_232	25	In a study by the organization, Deutsche Bank hardly changed compared to 2019 and continues to perform very weakly.
DE_232	26	"The Urgewald organization even accuses Deutsche Bank of ""opportunism""."
DE_232	27	"""Deutsche Bank is not doing justice to the climate crisis with this window-dressing,"" says Regine Richter from Urgewald."
DE_232	28	At the same time, it is holding on to fossil fuel businesses.
DE_232	29	"For example, it will organize the IPO of Wintershall DEA, which wants to increase its oil and gas business by 30 percent ""against all climate reason""."
DE_232	30	Deutsche Bank's client list could be extended to include names such as ExxonMobil, Glencore and Chevron.
DE_232	31	"""What would make a big difference to Deutsche Bank would be stricter exclusion rules for fossil fuel customers."""
DE_232	32	However, the rules it announced last year for the coal, oil and gas sectors are far too weak compared to the competition.
DE_235	1	Car industry: fear of the ice age
DE_235	2	Since Russian President Vladimir Putin announced last week that he would only accept roubles for energy deliveries, the industry, with its 800,000 or so jobs, has been preparing for the worst-case scenario.
DE_235	3	The gas continued to flow at the weekend.
DE_235	4	But experts are not giving the all-clear.
DE_235	5	Payment for deliveries received in March is often not due until mid-April.
DE_235	6	"""The real thing is yet to come,"" says an insider."
DE_235	7	The automotive industry only needs a fraction of the amount of gas that the steel or chemical industries, for example, burn.
DE_235	8	But the worries are great.
DE_235	9	In the short term, i.e. by the end of the year, only a small proportion of consumption could be replaced by other raw materials.
DE_235	10	"Andreas Rade, Managing Director of the industry association VDA in Berlin, knows what threatens in the event of a gas shortage: ""Our supply chains are under dramatic stress,"" Rade told the Süddeutsche Zeitung."
DE_235	11	"""We would quickly notice bottlenecks."""
DE_235	12	The Ukraine crisis has already shown how much the industry depends on meticulously planned deliveries in practically all areas.
DE_235	13	Because, for example, cable harnesses from Ukraine were missing - bundles of cables without which no car can roll off the production line - production in Germany came to a standstill in several plants.
DE_235	14	In the event of a gas freeze, the consequences would be even greater.
DE_235	15	"""There will then be considerable disruption to the production of vehicles in Germany."
DE_235	16	"This could result in longer delivery times for car buyers,"" warns Rade."
DE_235	17	"""But of course it's also about jobs, which we have to secure."""
DE_235	18	Companies have long since switched to crisis mode.
DE_235	19	In order to find replacements for cable harnesses from Ukrainian factories, for example, the VW Group has set up a crisis team that meets in the Wolfsburg soccer stadium.
DE_235	20	Wires, plugs and cables - it's complicated, but a solution is possible.
DE_235	21	Parts production in North African plants can be ramped up.
DE_235	22	And courageous employees are keeping production going in Ukraine.
DE_235	23	When it comes to gas, things become more difficult.
DE_235	24	Some companies will compensate for the shortage with other energy sources.
DE_235	25	At VW in Wolfsburg, contrary to plans, they still want to run their power plant on coal this year and not switch to more climate-friendly gas.
DE_235	26	But gas cannot be replaced everywhere.
DE_235	27	Whether it's the foam in the seats, electric car batteries or catalytic converters - many things depend on gas-based chemicals.
DE_235	28	The uncertainty in the industry is immense, it is said.
DE_235	29	The federal government is keeping the industry very well informed, they say.
DE_235	30	But it is also difficult to predict exactly which customer will still receive gas in the event of a shortage.
DE_235	31	The industry must now even fear that shortages of other raw materials could follow gas.
DE_235	32	Moscow is already discussing the expansion of the rouble practice to other areas.
DE_235	33	"""We also have to be prepared for shortages and price increases for other raw materials,"" continues VDA man Rade."
DE_235	34	One fifth of the palladium imported into Germany comes from Russia.
DE_235	35	The raw material is used for catalysts.
DE_235	36	Russia is also an important supplier of nickel, which is needed for the production of batteries for electric cars.
DE_235	37	Intensive efforts are being made to ensure reliable deliveries.
DE_235	38	At least the fact that the industry has a certain crisis routine is currently helping, VDA Managing Director Rade is certain.
DE_235	39	"""We've all been in crisis mode for the third year now due to coronavirus."""
DE_247	1	Deutsche Bahn: Only 70 percent of long-distance trains were on time in June
DE_247	2	The number of passengers using Deutsche Bahn's long-distance services rose again in the first six months of this year.
DE_247	3	71.8 million passengers traveled on ICE and IC trains, 1.3 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced in a half-year report.
DE_247	4	Deutsche Bahn expects the number of passengers to exceed 150 million for the first time by the end of the year.
DE_247	5	By comparison, 70.9 million passengers used long-distance rail services in the first six months of 2018.
DE_247	6	Last year as a whole, a record 148 million passengers were transported.
DE_247	7	Despite high passenger numbers, the rail company's profit fell by more than a fifth in the first half of 2019.
DE_247	8	At 757 million euros, the surplus was 22 percent below the previous year's figure.
DE_247	9	In contrast, turnover rose slightly to around 22 billion euros.
DE_247	10	However, this key figure also fell short of the company's own plans, as Group documents available to the Reuters news agency show.
DE_247	11	The freight railroad, which has been in crisis for years, but also local passenger transport is causing problems.
DE_247	12	"According to the annual report, the development of the business areas is ""predominantly strained""."
DE_247	13	In addition, numerous delays are currently damaging the railroad's reputation.
DE_247	14	In June, storms and heat meant that only just under 70 percent of long-distance trains arrived at their destination on time.
DE_247	15	This was the weakest June figure for six years.
DE_247	16	The Group was unable to improve its punctuality rate throughout the first half of the year compared to the same period last year.
DE_247	17	It remained at 77.2%.
DE_247	18	A train is considered punctual in the statistics if it arrives up to six minutes after the scheduled time.
DE_247	19	The so-called Monopolies Commission, which advises the German government and publishes a report on the state of the railroads every two years, calls for rapid investment.
DE_247	20	The quality problems of Deutsche Bahn make the political goal of bringing more traffic onto the railways increasingly unlikely, summarizes the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in advance of the new report.
DE_247	21	"""In order to strengthen rail transport, not only investments in infrastructure are necessary, but also changes to the institutional framework,"" the Chairman of the Monopolies Commission, economist Achim Wambach, told the newspaper."
DE_247	22	The Commission is therefore proposing, among other things, an insurance policy that could supplement general passenger rights.
DE_247	23	The railroads would then have to pay more for delays than before, which would provide an incentive to be more punctual.
DE_247	24	With its Strong Rail concept, Deutsche Bahn aims to almost double the number of passengers on long-distance services by 2030, while the number of passengers on regional trains is set to increase by half.
DE_247	25	The number of long-distance trains is set to increase from around 460 to up to 600 during this period.
DE_252	1	Lufthansa refrains from laying off pilots in the upswing
DE_252	2	Contrary to earlier announcements, Lufthansa does not intend to lay off any more pilots this spring.
DE_252	3	The global recovery in demand would lead to significantly better prospects in the cockpit in the long term, the company explained the move in Frankfurt on Friday.
DE_252	4	This means that Lufthansa's core brand can also do without compulsory redundancies.
DE_252	5	The company, which has since been rescued by the state, is still suffering from the coronavirus slump and is only flying around half the number of passengers it used to before the crisis in the current quarter.
DE_252	6	The Lufthansa Group employs around 11,000 pilots, around 5,000 of whom work for the core brand.
DE_252	7	During the coronavirus crisis, the MDax company announced that it would reduce its workforce from around 140,000 to up to 100,000 people worldwide.
DE_252	8	"According to the ""Handelsblatt"" newspaper, the downsizing is now set to end with just under 107,000 employees."
DE_252	9	According to reports, more than 400 Lufthansa captains have decided to leave their jobs early in return for severance pay.
DE_252	10	Lufthansa announced on Friday that it would also offer this route to co-pilots.
DE_252	11	A volunteer program is also to be introduced at the actually successful Lufthansa Cargo.
DE_252	12	In addition, collective part-time models could solve the existing staff surplus.
DE_252	13	Fundamental agreements have yet to be reached with the trade union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC), whose collective bargaining committee will be meeting for several days next week.
DE_252	14	"Chief Human Resources Officer Michael Niggemann described it as a ""great success"" to have averted the compulsory redundancies."
DE_252	15	They have worked hard to achieve this.
DE_252	16	"""Lufthansa is taking a long overdue step,"" said Stefan Herth, President of Vereinigung Cockpit."
DE_252	17	"""The booking situation looks good, and the Group needs the full strength of all employees to be efficient in the upcoming summer."""
DE_252	18	VC firmly believes that the outstanding issues for cockpit staff at Germanwings and Lufthansa Aviation Training will be resolved in the near future.
DE_252	19	Nevertheless, the company expects further savings contributions from regular pilots.
DE_252	20	In other Group airlines such as Eurowings and Eurowings Discover, new appointments are advertised at lower rates.
DE_252	21	The future of just over 200 pilots from the liquidated subsidiary Germanwings is also still unclear. 80 of their colleagues have already been transferred to Lufthansa in Munich.
DE_252	22	Lufthansa also announced that it would resume its pilot training program, which had been interrupted in the meantime, in the summer.
DE_252	23	Unlike in the past, there will no longer be any courses that almost automatically lead to the core brand being discontinued.
DE_252	24	The uniform training objective is now the generally recognized ATP commercial pilot license, which graduates can use to apply for jobs with employers within and outside the Lufthansa Group.
DE_252	25	Training locations are the flight school in Goodyear/Arizona, Rostock-Laage and, for theory, Bremen and Zurich, which were sold to United.
DE_261	1	Ukraine war: The situation on Monday Sanctions against the Russian central bank in force - rouble plummets
DE_261	2	The European Union increased the pressure on Russia.
DE_261	3	The Ukrainian armed forces are to receive weapons and equipment worth half a billion euros.
DE_261	4	The material is to be transported to Ukraine via a Polish logistics base; the EU defense ministers wanted to discuss the details this Monday.
DE_261	5	The EU also imposed sanctions against the Russian central bank.
DE_261	6	US President Joe Biden wants to discuss the next steps with allies and partners this Monday.
DE_261	7	The Russian central bank is responding to the currency crisis caused by Western sanctions with a drastic interest rate hike.
DE_261	8	The key interest rate will rise from 9.5 to 20 percent, as the monetary authorities announced in Moscow on Monday.
DE_261	9	At the same time, they signaled their willingness to make further increases.
DE_261	10	The head of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, plans to explain the measures at a press conference later today.
DE_261	11	Russia's escalating conflict with the West following the invasion of Ukraine caused the country's currency to plummet.
DE_261	12	In turn, the dollar rose by almost 42 percent at times on Monday to a record high of 119 roubles.
DE_261	13	Higher interest rates can help stabilize the exchange rate and also slow down inflation, but they also make loans more expensive - for investments, for example.
DE_261	14	Domestic companies are also to sell 80 percent of their foreign exchange earnings, the central bank and the Ministry of Finance have announced.
DE_261	15	According to information from Brussels and Berlin, the EU imposed the announced severe sanctions against the Russian central bank last night.
DE_261	16	They include a ban on transactions by the bank in relation to the high Russian currency reserves in euros.
DE_261	17	In addition, the bank's assets in the EU will be seized.
DE_261	18	Chancellery State Secretary Jörg Kukies announced in a tweet that the USA would take similar steps.
DE_261	19	According to information from Brussels and Berlin, the EU imposed the announced severe sanctions against the Russian central bank last night.
DE_261	20	They include a ban on transactions by the bank in relation to the high Russian currency reserves in euros.
DE_261	21	In addition, the bank's assets in the EU will be seized.
DE_261	22	Chancellery State Secretary Jörg Kukies announced in a tweet that the USA would take similar steps.
DE_261	23	According to the company, the Facebook accounts of several public figures in Ukraine, including military representatives and politicians, have been the target of hacker attacks.
DE_261	24	According to the Facebook parent company Meta, attempts were made to disseminate YouTube videos from the accounts in which Ukrainian troops are portrayed as weakened.
DE_261	25	Measures have been taken to secure the accounts concerned.
DE_261	26	Read also: Serious hacker attacks against Ukraine accompanied Russia's invasion.
DE_261	27	Security experts fear that the online conflict could also spread to Germany and the EU.
DE_261	28	According to the foreign ministry, Japan is considering sanctions against people from Belarus, including high-ranking members of the government.
DE_261	29	The Japanese government hopes to be able to make a decision at the earliest possible date, says head of state Fumio Kishida.
DE_261	30	Japan is currently working together with Western countries to implement the Swift exclusion of Russia.
DE_267	1	Zweibrücken's application to become a model municipality comes to nothing
DE_267	2	Although Zweibrücken's application to become a model municipality in Rhineland-Palatinate during the coronavirus pandemic is still officially on the table in Mainz, it will not come to fruition.
DE_267	3	"""The ministry has informed us that the model and therefore our application is on hold,"" says Lord Mayor Marold Wosnitza."
DE_267	4	The reason for this is that the state government's phased plan with the intended opening steps has overtaken the model, Wosnitza explains.
DE_267	5	Many tests for the coronavirus should also make it possible to go to the cinema and theater, to restaurants and cafés, and to lead an almost normal public life during the pandemic.
DE_267	6	The model was the Tübingen model.
DE_267	7	The Rhineland-Palatinate state government had commissioned its development agency to draw up criteria for model municipalities, from 30.
DE_267	8	March and to examine concepts with which the cities and districts want to enable extensive normalization for trade, services, gastronomy, culture and sport.
DE_267	9	The prerequisite was that the local spread of the virus was low and the seven-day incidence had to be below 50 at the time of application.
DE_267	10	That was the case in Zweibrücken at the time of the application.
DE_267	11	Mayor Wosnitza advocated increasing capacity by offering many more rapid tests, also with the financial involvement of tradespeople, in order to gain room for maneuver.
DE_267	12	"""It's about the field between incidence 50 and 100."
DE_267	13	"As an approved model municipality, we can do more while limiting the risk."" The city council itself created the conditions for using the Luca app."
DE_267	14	It enables digital, automated contact tracing during visits to public institutions and stores.
DE_267	15	If the worst comes to the worst, it is quicker for the public health department to reconstruct transmission routes and isolate possible infected persons, then test them safely and with laboratory confirmation.
DE_267	16	The city registered public facilities such as the town hall, festival halls and sports halls for the Luca registration procedure.
DE_267	17	However, the Rhineland-Palatinate Perspective Plan points the way to more normality even without model recognition.
DE_267	18	With a lot of discipline and care, all citizens are once again called upon to avoid new infections and to keep the incidence below the 50 mark.
DE_267	19	According to the plan, visits to restaurants and cultural events under the roof would be possible from Friday of this week, after five days following an incidence below 50, and with a negative rapid test.
DE_267	20	However, Zweibrücken is nowhere near the mark.
DE_267	21	On Tuesday, the number of cases forwarded by the State Investigation Office to the Robert Koch Institute was 73.
DE_267	22	However, the incidence is falling significantly.
DE_267	23	According to the state government's plan, outdoor sporting events with up to 100 spectators who have tested negative will be permitted from Friday - even if the incidence remains stable at under 100.
DE_267	24	In the third stage from June 2, the rules are to be relaxed further - always below the 100 limit, where the stricter national rules apply.
DE_270	1	Five years of psychiatry in the heart of the town: kbo Isar Amper-Klinikum takes stock and looks ahead
DE_270	2	Bringing medicine to the people and creating short distances for mental health problems - that was the goal five years ago when the kbo Isar-Amper-Klinikum opened in the middle of a residential area in Bruck on September 29, 2016.
DE_270	3	A lot has happened in five years.
DE_270	4	Managers of the psychiatric clinic look back and name the biggest challenges for the coming years.
DE_270	5	We can build clinics and buy beds, but above all we need people with expertise and commitment.
DE_270	6	District President Josef Mederer.
DE_270	7	"District President Josef Mederer is delighted that this ""huge step into the future"" was successful five years ago and expresses his thanks to those responsible: ""We can build clinics and buy beds, but above all we need people with expertise and commitment to tackle challenges."" Head Physician Nicolay Marstrander and Head of Nursing Nina Tantarn are people who live and nurture the values and message of the clinic: The end stigmatization of mental illness."
DE_270	8	The clinic is also like this: open doors without a fence.
DE_270	9	According to Medical Director Peter Brieger, the clinic is being observed throughout Germany for this model concept.
DE_270	10	"Marstrander talks about the challenges of recent years: ""We first had to network locally."
DE_270	11	So that GPs, for example, know where they can send their patients with mental health problems.
DE_270	12	"We have succeeded in dovetailing this well."""
DE_270	13	High demand.
DE_270	14	The following figures show that demand is high: In Upper Bavaria alone, there were 30,000 calls to the crisis hotline last year.
DE_270	15	The clinic itself receives up to 60 calls a day from people who don't know what to do.
DE_270	16	"""It could be the alcohol addict from Dachau, the police who had to arrest a confused man at the train station or Mrs. Müller, whose husband with dementia keeps running away,"" Marstrander lists examples."
DE_270	17	The four stations.
DE_270	18	"Four wards have been established in the clinic over the years: Acute Psychiatry Unit, where, for example, schizophrenic psychoses are treated, the Addiction Unit, Geriatric Psychiatry, which offers a treatment room for people in old age, and the ""Crisis"" Unit."
DE_270	19	Depending on the case, inpatient, day clinic, outpatient or home treatment is possible.
DE_270	20	Growing demand due to more inhabitants.
DE_270	21	According to nursing service manager Nina Tantarn, the latter in particular is to be further expanded in the future.
DE_270	22	"The aim cannot be to provide more beds, but to create more services that make hospitalization unnecessary,"" says Mederer, summarizing his political goal."
DE_270	23	The biggest challenge is to meet the growing demand that automatically arises from the constant influx of new residents.
DE_275	1	"City budget 2022: ""Gelsenkirchen is better than Berlin"""
DE_275	2	"""Gelsenkirchen is better than Berlin"": What did Susanne Cichos, leader of the FDP parliamentary group, mean by this sentence - certainly one of the most striking sentences in the speeches on the 2022 budget?"
DE_275	3	The fact that the figures were approved on Thursday afternoon by an unprecedented majority in the city council, which has even more colors than the capital's traffic lights.
DE_275	4	"""Gelsenkirchen can do red, black, green and yellow,"" said Cichos."
DE_275	5	"""This proves that a parliament of a city with 260,000 inhabitants is big politics on a small scale."" PARTEI wants to hire ""granny from the Feldmark""."
DE_275	6	"Peter Tertocha, parliamentary group leader of the Greens, put it a little less pathetically: ""Of course, the financial ideas and also the design of some proposals were sometimes a little different at the beginning, but in the end we found a compromise fairly quickly."" The budget was only rejected by the AfD parliamentary groups, the WIN and individual mandate holder Jan Specht from AUF ""Tierschutz hier!"
DE_275	7	""" also voted in favor, the PARTEI abstained - apparently because the following idea of the satirical party was not mentioned: To find a position for a senior citizen from Gelsenkirchen in the treasury."
DE_275	8	PARTEI councillor Gregor Stein:
DE_275	9	"""Because nobody can manage as well on a small budget as a granny from the field."""
DE_275	10	The financial leeway in Gelsenkirchen, which is poor and burdened by the consequences of the coronavirus, is manageable.
DE_275	11	At the end of September, city treasurer Luidger Wolterhoff presented the draft budget with expenditure of 1.2 billion, which has been filled with further life in recent weeks and months through political motions.
DE_275	12	The new projects, which have been incorporated into the budget thanks to initiatives from local politicians, now amount to around 1.6 million euros.
DE_275	13	Gelsenkirchen Groko sets regulatory focus.
DE_275	14	The two main architects of the budget, the CDU and SPD , each gave their budget speeches a security and regulatory focus.
DE_275	15	The coalition partners both emphasized that it is firmly cemented that the municipal public order service will double its staffing levels by 2025.
DE_275	16	"""A success that the CDU has advanced here in the council,"" emphasized Julian Pfeiffers, Managing Director of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, who also mentioned projects such as an analysis of potential for further high-quality residential areas, an e-sports concept for Gelsenkirchen and a digital training fair."
DE_275	17	Lukas Günther, budget policy spokesperson for the Social Democrats, also emphasized that the 2022 budget is a further step towards advancing the construction of three additional elementary school and three secondary schools.
DE_275	18	"""I'm sure we'll look back on this time in a few years and talk about the 'decade of school construction',"" says Günther."
DE_275	19	"The AfD's superlatives were only in the negative: ""The budget plan lacks innovation, a willingness to tackle the uncomfortable problems on our doorstep, and it lacks the energetic vehemence of the leadership to want to maintain social peace,"" said deputy parliamentary group leader Enxhi Seli-Zacharias."
DE_275	20	"The parliamentary group sees the ""pressing problems"" in the consequences of immigration, for example, and less in the ""climate relevance"" of budget projects - for Seli-Zacharias a ""standard vocabulary of ideologically dressed-up zealots""."
DE_275	21	"But even in the nationally ridiculed #401-Gelsenkirchen ""you can do Hollywood"", as Susanne Cichos from the FDP emphasized once again."
DE_275	22	"There was talk of the ""Walk of Fame"", which is now also in the budget and is due to come to Buer in 2022 - and has already made headlines in national media such as ""Der Spiegel"" and the ""Süddeutsche Zeitung""."
DE_280	1	Coal phase-out in Lusatia: What comes after coal?
DE_280	2	In February, after months of negotiations, the Coal Commission recommended the phase-out for 2038.
DE_280	3	A hard-won compromise that was greeted with palpable relief in Weißwasser and the surrounding area.
DE_280	4	"Torsten Pötzsch is also relieved, although not without concern: ""We have to take the middle way,"" he says."
DE_280	5	"""Don't get out too quickly, but don't put off the appointment either."
DE_280	6	"As long as we get new, well-paid jobs."" In other words: as long as funding is made available for the transition, as long as the region receives political attention."
DE_280	7	And that is what she is currently getting.
DE_280	8	In the evening, Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer will come to Weißwasser and discuss structural change with Torsten Pötzsch.
DE_280	9	The jacket is already in the car.
DE_280	10	An independent conquers the town hall.
DE_280	11	Pötzsch stands for a different type of politician: non-partisan, pragmatic.
DE_280	12	He was eighteen at the time of the fall of the Wall.
DE_280	13	"Actually, he ""always wanted to leave"", like almost everyone of his generation."
DE_280	14	Pötzsch stayed, became a savings bank business economist and was self-employed in the cultural sector for a few years until he became managing director of the Weißwasser municipal housing association.
DE_280	15	He was right in the middle of the city's transformation.
DE_280	16	The observation tower with panoramic views suggests that industrial culture, renaturation and tourism could one day play a role here.
DE_280	17	Pötzsch estimates that between 500 and 1,000 people from Weißwasser still work in coal or at the power plant.
DE_280	18	It's not an easy job.
DE_280	19	And not an easy job on the city council.
DE_280	20	This has to do with the desolate budget situation, which is not only struggling with a shrinking population and falling incomes.
DE_280	21	"Like many municipalities, Weißwasser had to pay back trade taxes, according to Pötzsch ""in the double-digit millions"", which the municipality had received from the ."
DE_280	22	The nuclear phase-out had reduced the energy company's profits.
DE_280	23	In the meantime, Vattenfall has withdrawn completely from lignite, and Leag, an energy company with a Czech majority shareholding, has taken over.
DE_280	24	There are currently no trade taxes and sponsorship money is now flowing in in much smaller sums.
DE_280	25	Always these finances.
DE_280	26	Some of the tax receivables were repaid from the remaining reserves.
DE_280	27	But Weißwasser has a structural budget problem due to the shrinking process.
DE_280	28	Since then, a dispute has been simmering between the mayor and the city council as to whether further cuts in municipal staff can be made, whether volunteer projects should be abandoned, whether daycare centers can be outsourced, whether the small zoo or the library should be closed.
DE_280	29	It's time to get down to business.
DE_280	30	It gets to your kidneys.
DE_280	31	No, says Torsten Pötzsch, you simply can't save any more.
DE_280	32	This is where structural change comes in handy.
DE_280	33	It would make sense to reduce trade taxes in the region and give the municipalities a flat-rate financial compensation.
DE_280	34	Efficient companies would then settle here and the existing ones would also gain economic strength.
DE_280	35	"Any ""investment promotion"" for large-scale projects is expensive and creates new crises if these investments become obsolete after 10 years and no self-sustaining structures have been created."
DE_280	36	In a battery factory, for example, most of the workforce is created in the short term by the suppliers of the relevant equipment.
DE_283	1	Julia Reda: She has already won
DE_283	2	"""Julia, Julia, Julia!"" chant hundreds of demonstrators in front of the Brandenburg Gate as Julia Reda takes to the small stage on Saturday."
DE_283	3	32 years old, the only female member of the European Parliament, the last German female pirate in a parliament.
DE_283	4	Some MPs are not even recognized on the street in their constituency.
DE_283	5	Almost everyone here knows Reda.
DE_283	6	"The previous speaker described her as the ""Joan of Arc of the Internet""."
DE_283	7	As David fighting against the Goliaths.
DE_283	8	For the protesters, Reda is their woman in .
DE_283	9	She is the face of the movement against the planned EU copyright reform.
DE_283	10	It is a topic that she has chosen herself.
DE_283	11	Over the years, she has repeatedly informed the public about the current status of each round of negotiations, documented the versions of the directive, reported to her almost 75,000 followers on Twitter, stood in front of television cameras and explained her position.
DE_283	12	She warns that the directive will fundamentally change the Internet as we know it today.
DE_283	13	That the current wording of the law in Article 13 (Article 17 in the final version) will result in upload filters, which are not only expensive but also prone to errors.
DE_283	14	That the platforms would be liable in the future and would therefore be rather overzealous in complying with the law.
DE_283	15	That this means restrictions on freedom of speech.
DE_283	16	She has already won.
DE_283	17	Reda has found supporters for these views among young people, YouTubers and net activists.
DE_283	18	Five million people have now signed a petition against the reform, and last Saturday around 100,000 people took to the streets across Germany.
DE_283	19	Regardless of the outcome of the vote on EU copyright law in the European Parliament on Tuesday, you could say that Julia Reda has actually already won it.
DE_283	20	Because it made it seem only possible that the directive could still be overturned.
DE_283	21	That is remarkable.
DE_283	22	Not only because the Pirate politician has mobilized so many people for a rather dull topic such as copyright, but also because she sits in the EU Parliament for a party that has long since disappeared into insignificance.
DE_283	23	But Julia Reda's story is not just one of success.
DE_283	24	It is also one of disappointment.
DE_283	25	Julia Reda, born in Bonn in 1986, joined the SPD at the age of 16, but was unable to come to terms with their position on internet bans and switched to the Pirate Party in 2009.
DE_283	26	This was not unusual at the time; many internet-savvy people were looking for a new political home at the time, disappointed by the net politics of other parties.
DE_283	27	The Pirates moved into one state parliament after another: Saarland, Schleswig-Holstein, North Rhine-Westphalia.
DE_283	28	They were seen as the next Greens, as a party that takes up an issue that other parties neglect, but which is becoming increasingly important to voters.
DE_283	29	The pirates shaped political network debates.
DE_283	30	One of their big battles was against the planned trade agreement Acta.
DE_283	31	Officially, it was intended to combat product piracy and copyright infringements, but critics feared that it was an invasion of privacy.
DE_283	32	Almost ten years ago, she had already stood here and demonstrated against Acta, says Reda in her speech.
DE_283	33	Even then, people demonstrated against the attempt to regulate copyright in the digital world.
DE_283	34	Things didn't look good back then either, but they didn't give up.
DE_283	35	And so Acta was stopped.
DE_283	36	Back then, tens of thousands also took to the streets.
DE_283	37	With success: first Germany and other EU countries refused to sign the agreement, later it was completely overturned in the EU Parliament.
DE_283	38	"""That was the moment when I thought: I'm going into politics myself,"" says Reda."
DE_283	39	The people in front of the stage applaud.
DE_286	1	"Top topics ""Partygate"": Downing Street failed to meet standards Parties in Downing Street during the pandemic: The long-awaited investigation report accuses those responsible of serious failures..."
DE_286	2	"An investigation report into the ""Partygate"" affair has accused those responsible at the British seat of government of failing in their leadership and seriously breaking the rules."
DE_286	3	Those responsible had failed to adhere to standards that had been demanded not only by the government but by the entire population at the time of the corona lockdowns, according to the report by top official Sue Gray published on Monday.
DE_286	4	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is under heavy pressure, is not directly criticized at any point.
DE_286	5	The opposition, however, insisted on his resignation.
DE_286	6	Gray emphasized that some of the meetings should not have taken place or should not have developed in the way they did.
DE_286	7	"The behavior of some of those involved was ""difficult to justify""."
DE_286	8	There had been a clear failure of leadership in various areas of Number 10 Downing Street and the associated Cabinet Office, the central government department.
DE_286	9	In addition, too little thought had obviously been given to the health risks posed by some gatherings and how they might appear to the public in the context of the national emergency.
DE_286	10	Investigations by Scotland Yard.
DE_286	11	"Gray demanded: ""Important lessons must be learned from these events, which must be addressed immediately across the government."" There is no need to wait for the police investigation to be completed."
DE_286	12	Scotland Yard is conducting its own parallel investigations into meetings in Downing Street - according to Gray, into 12 of the 16 events under investigation.
DE_286	13	The authority had therefore asked the officer to make only minimal reference to these parties in her report.
DE_286	14	The report is therefore considered to be weaker than its original version - to which the official herself refers.
DE_286	15	"What she can say about some events is ""extremely limited"" and it is therefore currently impossible to provide a meaningful summary of all her information."
DE_286	16	Instead, Gray names specific points that she believes should change in the British seat of government.
DE_286	17	"""Excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate at any time in a professional working environment,"" she wrote."
DE_286	18	In addition, the number of employees in Downing Street has grown considerably, but there are no clear responsibilities, which prevents smooth processes.
DE_286	19	Prime Minister Johnson, who received the report on Monday afternoon, wanted to comment on it in the House of Commons in London in the afternoon and, according to media reports, meet with the parliamentary group of his Tory party in the evening.
DE_286	20	If at least 54 MPs vote no confidence in the Prime Minister, Johnson will have to face a vote.
DE_286	21	However, due to the slowdown and the ongoing police investigations, this is currently considered less likely again.
DE_287	1	Climate Protection Act CSU puts CDU under pressure on climate protection
DE_287	2	"Armin Laschet wanted to avoid a ""numbers contest"", but the Bavarian sister party is now giving him one."
DE_287	3	The CSU wants a climate-neutral Germany by 2045.
DE_287	4	Following the Karlsruhe objections to the German Climate Protection Act, the CSU is increasing the pressure.
DE_287	5	"Alexander Dobrindt, head of the regional group, said on Tuesday in Berlin that they now wanted to react ""immediately"" to the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court."
DE_287	6	"""We want to achieve climate neutrality by 2045,"" said Dobrindt."
DE_287	7	This figure relates to the whole of Germany.
DE_287	8	On Monday, CSU leader Markus Söder announced Bavaria's intention to be climate-neutral by 2040.
DE_287	9	This is not the first time that the impression has arisen that the CSU is trying to drive its bigger sister before it.
DE_287	10	CDU Chairman Armin Laschet did not want to commit to a specific year for a climate-neutral Germany after his party's executive committee meeting on Monday.
DE_287	11	"Laschet merely said that he was aiming for climate neutrality ""well before the middle of this century""."
DE_287	12	Every year that is mentioned must be carefully substantiated and have substance.
DE_287	13	"""That's why we didn't enter into a numbers competition,"" said Laschet."
DE_287	14	"The figure 2045 is ""our CSU position"", said Dobrindt."
DE_287	15	"However, his impression was that his interlocutors in the CDU were sympathetic to this. 2045 and ""well before 2050"", he sees an ""aligned idea"", he said."
DE_287	16	Dobrindt also forged ahead with the CO₂ price.
DE_287	17	It was only introduced this year and since then a surcharge of 25 euros per tonne of CO₂ has been payable on heating and motor fuels.
DE_287	18	The price is to rise gradually.
DE_287	19	Dobrindt wants this surcharge to reach 45 euros as early as next year.
DE_287	20	So far, this level is not planned until 2024.
DE_287	21	An increase will result in higher fuel prices, among other things.
DE_287	22	A dispute with the SPD is brewing over the CO₂ price.
DE_287	23	"Before a meeting of the CDU parliamentary group, CDU parliamentary deputy Andreas Jung called Dobrindt's price proposal ""very interesting""."
DE_287	24	However, there are various options and they are currently working through the calculations.
DE_287	25	"""We agree that the price path must become faster,"" said Jung."
DE_287	26	Revenue from a higher CO₂ price could be passed on to electricity customers via a reduction in the green electricity levy.
DE_287	27	And the CDU and CSU now also appear to be on the same page when it comes to the long-term target: by 2030, emissions are to be reduced by 65 percent below 1990 levels instead of 55 percent.
DE_287	28	"Jung added a ""at least"" in front of the number."
DE_287	29	However, a dispute is now brewing with the coalition partner over the CO₂ price.
DE_287	30	"The SPD parliamentary group deputy leader Matthias Miersch said that they were ""ready to negotiate day and night"", for example on an accelerated expansion of green electricity."
DE_287	31	"However, the CO₂ price is an instrument ""that needs to be considered very, very carefully""."
DE_287	32	After all, it could easily overwhelm the socially disadvantaged.
DE_287	33	"Group leader Rolf Mützenich warned against ""contributing even further to a social imbalance here in Germany""."
DE_287	34	The CDU/CSU and SPD had already clashed on this issue during the consultations on the previous law.
DE_288	1	To keep speculators away: Municipal council adopts qualified development plan for Höfen
DE_288	2	Nobody wants speculators in the villages.
DE_288	3	This is precisely the reason why the municipal council decided against a simple development plan in the Höfen case.
DE_288	4	Königsdorf For some time now, Königsdorf's local councillors have been working on a sensible development plan for the northern district of Höfen.
DE_288	5	At their April meeting, they had actually agreed to draw up a simple plan, partly because they saw this as the best way of enabling local residents to build easily and quickly on the relatively large plots of land north of the road as part of a moderate densification process.
DE_288	6	At the most recent meeting, the decision was reversed: The committee voted unanimously in favor of a qualified development plan.
DE_288	7	The change of heart was triggered by a presentation by Katrin Feuerstein from the Munich Outer Economic Area Planning Association.
DE_288	8	The graduate engineer initially set out her goals.
DE_288	9	The plan is intended to define an open construction method with detached and semi-detached houses - with one residential unit per completed 400 square meters.
DE_288	10	Exceptions are the three plots on which a distance to the forest must be maintained.
DE_288	11	The plan should also define a large construction area for each individual plot, on which individual buildings or a large house can be erected.
DE_288	12	The floor area ratio for main buildings should be 0.18.
DE_288	13	Merge properties?
DE_288	14	Works with a simple development plan.
DE_288	15	A point of discussion in the ensuing debate was the depth of the roof overhangs.
DE_288	16	The majority of the houses in Höfen date from the 1970s and 80s - low buildings with flat pitched roofs and small overhangs.
DE_288	17	"For Bernhard Woisetschläger ""no longer in keeping with the times""."
DE_288	18	A roof should already tower over balconies, said the UBL council.
DE_288	19	It also quickly became clear why the expert advised the Königsdorf residents against a simple development plan with one large building window instead of several individual ones.
DE_288	20	On the one hand, with a simple plan, the district office would have to check every building project; exemption procedures are not possible.
DE_288	21	"According to Feuerstein, the authority is guided by the surrounding buildings, ""and that can be a disadvantage, because the wall heights there, for example, are very low""."
DE_288	22	"A qualified plan, on the other hand, would define maximum wall and ridge heights - based on a high outlier in courtyards - ""and everyone knows what will happen there later""."
DE_288	23	The distances to the property boundaries would also be set in stone in this case.
DE_288	24	A simple development plan, however, would leave open the possibility of merging plots.
DE_288	25	"According to Feuerstein, this could lead to ""investors building multi-storey apartments""."
DE_288	26	This made some councillors prick up their ears.
DE_288	27	"Hans Hartl (CSU) warned against speculators: ""Houses are always being sold out there too."
DE_288	28	What can be built on these huge construction windows?
DE_288	29	"We should be on our guard."" UBL councillor Georg Stöckl agreed with Hartl: ""There is something to the possibility of massive boundary development with a continuous building line."
DE_288	30	"And since, as we have heard, a qualified plan in the accelerated procedure does not take much longer than the simple one, I am now leaning towards the ""qualified"" one."
DE_288	31	This would help the current building applicant.
DE_288	32	All colleagues unanimously agreed - including Luise Seemayer (CSU), who had initially favored the simple plan.
DE_288	33	"""We can still clarify and regulate details such as roof pitch and overhangs in the further process,"" noted Mayor Rainer Kopnicky."

DE_294	1	Toothless representation of the people - few Tunisians elect parliament
DE_294	2	After the Arab uprisings, Tunisia was the region's democratic beacon of hope.
DE_294	3	But the president is sawing away at the achievements and is hardly allowing any power for a newly elected parliament.
DE_294	4	Tunis - The election for a new and significantly weakened parliament has got off to a slow start in Tunisia.
DE_294	5	By the afternoon, a good seven percent of the more than 9.2 million voters had taken part in the vote.
DE_294	6	"""People no longer trust the political process and the political representatives,"" says Malte Gaier, who heads the Konrad Adenauer Foundation's international office in Tunis."
DE_294	7	"""They don't expect any improvement from this election either."" Tunisia's head of state Kais Saied dissolved the old parliament at the end of March in order to weaken his political opponents and expand his own power."
DE_294	8	Since the introduction of a controversial new constitution in the summer, the head of state has been able to appoint and dismiss the government and judges without the approval of parliament.
DE_294	9	The new parliament will only have a few powers.
DE_294	10	Opposition called for a boycott.
DE_294	11	The opposition called for a boycott of the election.
DE_294	12	She accuses the president of undermining democracy.
DE_294	13	"The influential Tunisian trade union federation UGTT, which has a large membership and had long stood by Saied, also called the parliamentary election ""not very sensible""."
DE_294	14	For many Tunisians, Saied was a beacon of hope for a long time, but his popularity ratings are now falling rapidly.
DE_294	15	Many people struggle every day to make ends meet.
DE_294	16	Food has become expensive and sometimes scarce.
DE_294	17	In stores, mothers beg to be allowed to buy more than the permitted one carton of milk per person.
DE_294	18	Sugar and butter are also rarely available at the moment.
DE_294	19	More and more young Tunisians are making their way to Europe to find work and prospects.
DE_294	20	So far, politicians have not found any solutions to the economic upheavals and high unemployment in the country.
DE_294	21	The leadership in Tunis is currently negotiating a billion-euro loan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to avert national bankruptcy.
DE_294	22	"""The loan would keep the country going for the time being, but it won't get it out of the debt spiral,"" says Gaier."
DE_294	23	"""There is no politician in Tunisia who can really change the course."" The parliamentary elections will not change this."
DE_294	24	First results on Monday.
DE_294	25	The new parliament will consist of 161 members.
DE_294	26	However, there are no candidates in some constituencies, which means that the parliament will not be complete for the time being.
DE_294	27	The electoral commission expects the first results by Monday.
DE_294	28	The ex-law professor Saied also changed the electoral law before the vote.
DE_294	29	Citizens could now only vote for one representative per constituency.
DE_294	30	In previous elections, parties or party blocs ran with several candidates, which always had to include women.
DE_294	31	This obligation no longer applies.
DE_294	32	According to Human Rights Watch, 31 percent of the members of the deposed parliament were female due to the quota system.
DE_294	33	"""The Tunisian parliament was once the role model for gender equality in the region."
DE_294	34	"With these new legislative changes, that could soon be history,"" the organization wrote in a report."
DE_294	35	The parliamentary election will take place on the twelfth anniversary of the self-immolation of the Tunisian Mohammed Bouazizi.
DE_294	36	The death of the greengrocer at the end of 2010 triggered mass protests and political upheaval in several Arab countries.
DE_294	37	Tunisia was then the only country to make the transition to democracy.
DE_294	38	However, political power struggles and rampant corruption prevented lasting change.
DE_300	1	Politics G7 foreign ministers wrestle over joint China strategy
DE_300	2	At the G7 meeting in London, Federal Foreign Minister Heiko Maas advocated a joint China strategy with a stronger focus on human rights issues.
DE_300	3	"""There are economic interests everywhere, but questions of human rights and civil liberties must be given more space when it comes to China,"" said the SPD politician on Tuesday."
DE_300	4	China policy is a contentious issue in the G7 between the Europeans and the USA.
DE_300	5	The Americans have so far taken a much tougher line with Beijing.
DE_300	6	The actions of the Chinese leadership against the Muslim Uyghur minority are being denounced more harshly by the USA, and an investment agreement recently concluded between the European Union and China is being viewed critically by US allies.
DE_300	7	There are also differences regarding the possible involvement of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei in the expansion of the fast 5G mobile network.
DE_300	8	The G7 brings together the major western industrialized nations: The USA, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada.
DE_300	9	The foreign ministers had already met on Monday for their three-day meeting, which will cover all important international issues from China to Russia to Syria and from climate protection to combating the coronavirus pandemic.
DE_300	10	The focus is on how Western democracies position themselves vis-à-vis authoritarian states such as China and Russia.
DE_300	11	"""We are trying to uphold the international rules-based order in which our countries have invested so much over so many decades,"" said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken after his arrival in London."
DE_300	12	"If a country - be it China or another state - questions this order, ""we will stand up and defend the order""."
DE_300	13	This is the first face-to-face meeting of the G7 foreign ministers in two years.
DE_300	14	South Korea, Australia, India and South Africa have also been invited to the talks in London.
DE_300	15	The British Presidency wants to make the G7 even more of a central forum for the major democracies.
DE_300	16	Maas welcomed this approach.
DE_300	17	"""More and more authoritarian states or authoritarian leaders are trying to set their model against that of liberal democracies,"" he said."
DE_300	18	That is why it is good to define common values and develop common strategies within the G7.
DE_300	19	He cited free trade as an example.
DE_300	20	"""We, the G7, are the free world, and we want free trade instead of the gagging agreements we know from others."" For the UK and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the G7 presidency in the first year after Brexit is an opportunity to re-establish themselves as an energetic nation on the world stage."
DE_300	21	Since leaving the EU, Foreign Minister Dominic Raab has repeatedly voiced harsh criticism of human rights violations in China and Myanmar, for example.
DE_300	22	Without the EU, the United Kingdom would be able to react more flexibly and quickly, it is said in London.
DE_300	23	"Raab said: ""The UK G7 presidency is an opportunity to bring together open, democratic societies and demonstrate unity at a time of urgency to tackle common challenges and growing threats."" The meeting in London is intended to prepare for the G7 summit of heads of state and government in Cornwall from 11 to 13 March."
DE_300	24	June will be prepared.
DE_300	25	It will be the first major summit meeting with the new US President Joe Biden.
DE_300	26	During the term of office of his predecessor Donald Trump, the G7 lost a great deal of importance.
DE_300	27	Trump had little interest in the format of the talks, and on one occasion he even subsequently scrapped the final declaration.
DE_300	28	"""There was actually no longer a G7 in substance, because the United States had long since left in terms of content,"" Maas said at the time."
DE_300	29	"""That's different again now."" Now the group is to become the forum through which the competition between democracies and autocracies is to be fought out."
DE_300	30	The G7 conference is taking place under strict coronavirus restrictions.
DE_300	31	All those present must be tested daily for the virus.
DE_300	32	The conference will last until Wednesday and will then end with a joint final declaration.
DE_M_005	1	Security for all and a well-equipped police force that is close to the people
DE_M_005	2	Germany is basically a safe country.
DE_M_005	3	This is also due to the good work of the police.
DE_M_005	4	We want it to stay that way.
DE_M_005	5	Theft, burglaries, acts of violence, hate crimes and organized crime nevertheless place a heavy burden on victims and their families.
DE_M_005	6	We want to strengthen the police for their tasks such as prevention, education and prosecution and the protection of fundamental rights, in the city and in the countryside, analog and digital.
DE_M_005	7	We want to remedy the earlier staff cuts in the Federal Police and Federal Criminal Police Office by going on the offensive to fill vacancies and at the same time enable specialized training and courses of study.
DE_M_005	8	We want the police to reflect the diversity of the population.
DE_M_005	9	Police officers deserve our appreciation, as do good working conditions and efficient structures within the authorities.
DE_M_005	10	Secure and efficient data processing, combined with mobile IT and clearly defined competencies, is a basic requirement for modern police work.
DE_M_005	11	However, good police action cannot be a substitute for social problem-solving.
DE_M_005	12	We will therefore support and further expand cooperation with civilian organizations and external experts.
DE_M_005	13	The special responsibility of the police
DE_M_005	14	We want a society in which everyone can live freely and safely.
DE_M_005	15	Safety must be equally guaranteed everywhere.
DE_M_005	16	We do not treat civil liberties and citizens' rights as a scratching post in domestic policy, but as their central protected goods.
DE_M_005	17	Safety must not be a question of social class, origin, gender, sexual identity, appearance or place of residence.
DE_M_005	18	In order for the police to be able to perform their complex tasks, they must be able to build on the trust of the entire population.
DE_M_005	19	As the executive organ of the state's monopoly on the use of force, the police also have a special responsibility.
DE_M_005	20	This corresponds to the introduction of an individual but anonymized identification for the federal police and the position of an independent federal police commissioner with comprehensive powers, to whom both police officers and citizens can turn in the event of problems arising or grievances identified.
DE_M_005	21	Crimes committed in office and deaths in police custody must be investigated without ifs and buts.
DE_M_005	22	We will shape the powers of the Federal Police to carry out checks in such a way that they no longer lead to racial profiling, and we will test the introduction of so-called ticket systems to make the reasons for police checks transparent for those affected.
DE_M_005	23	Police officers should also be able and required to undergo mandatory further training after their training.
DE_M_005	24	Important training areas include dealing with people with mental illness, anti-discrimination and the risk of racial profiling.
DE_M_005	25	Particular stresses in the service should be regularly followed up, for example in the context of supervision.
DE_M_005	26	A nationwide, external specialist office for pastoral care and ethical education should be set up.
DE_M_005	27	The existing ZeBuS (Center for Ethical Education and Pastoral Care in the NRW Police) can serve as a model here.
DE_M_005	28	Independent scientific studies on right-wing extremism, anti-Semitism and racism in the security and law enforcement agencies are long overdue.
DE_M_005	29	We want to make police research more feasible and open up the police more to it.
DE_M_005	30	Rational security policy requires a solid factual basis and clear responsibilities.
DE_M_005	31	This is why we will reintroduce the Periodic Safety Report, among other things, which has proven its worth in the past.
DE_M_005	32	Combating right-wing extremism, breaking up networks
DE_M_005	33	There are more than 32,000 right-wing extremists in Germany who, despite their exclusionary nationalist approach, are also increasingly networking transnationally.
DE_M_005	34	The fight against right-wing extremist structures - also within the security authorities - must be a priority for all security agencies.
DE_M_005	35	This requires a bundle of prevention, protection and sanction measures.
DE_M_005	36	Through a nationwide networked prevention strategy, we want to massively expand prevention work and also focus on the anti-feminist and nationalist-ethnic dimension of right-wing extremism.
DE_M_005	37	"The latter includes, for example, the right-wing extremist and violent ""Ülkücü movement"", colloquially known as the ""Gray Wolves"", which we want to suppress with all the political and legal means at our disposal."
DE_M_005	38	Civil society groups are doing important work to raise awareness and push back right-wing extremist structures.
DE_M_005	39	They are to be supported structurally and in the long term by a law to promote democracy.
DE_M_005	40	We will initiate independent scientific studies on racism and right-wing extremism in the various security authorities, record hate violence and pursue it consistently.
DE_M_005	41	Right-wing extremists must be removed from security agencies more consistently and swiftly than before.
DE_M_005	42	We want to create the legal conditions for this.
DE_M_005	43	The series of murders by the right-wing terrorist NSU and other acts of racist and right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany - for example the murders in Hanau - have still not been fully dealt with.
DE_M_005	44	That is why we are setting up an archive on right-wing terror, based on the model of the Stasi Records Office, in which the documents and findings of the 13 parliamentary committees of inquiry into the NSU will also be evaluated and which will be accessible to researchers, journalists and civil society in the long term.
DE_M_005	45	Our solidarity goes out to all victims and those affected by right-wing terrorist, extreme right-wing and racist attacks.
DE_M_005	46	We therefore want to set up a fund at federal level for victims and those affected, in particular by right-wing extremist, racist or Islamist violence.
DE_M_005	47	Protect against terrorism
DE_M_005	48	Any form of politically motivated violence endangers our constitutional state.
DE_M_005	49	Public safety in Germany is threatened in particular by terrorism from violent right-wing extremists and Islamists.
DE_M_005	50	"In order to protect an open society, our democracy and the people, we must fight terror decisively - through effective intersectional prevention work, better networking of the security authorities and consistent monitoring of so-called ""Gefährder*innen""."
DE_M_005	51	"This requires a definition of the term ""dangerous"" that is coordinated at European level with legally verifiable classification and categorization criteria."
DE_M_005	52	People at risk must be closely monitored.
DE_M_005	53	The aim is to ensure that outstanding arrest warrants for dangerous individuals are consistently executed and that ongoing proceedings are consolidated across national borders.
DE_M_005	54	Cooperation and communication between the security authorities, including across national borders, must be reformed, including the creation of a legal basis for the GTAZ and GETZ counter-terrorism centers.
DE_M_005	55	"Beyond the fight against terrorism, we reject encroachments on fundamental rights based on a classification as a so-called ""Gefährder*in""."
DE_M_005	56	We will expand programs for people leaving the right-wing extremist and Islamist scene as well as support and advice services for victims and their families.
DE_M_005	57	A nationwide, professionalized prevention and deradicalization network is needed - similar to the civil society organizations that are already better networked than the political levels at federal and state level.
DE_M_005	58	We want to strengthen prevention and deradicalization in prisons.
DE_M_005	59	In order to make assassinations more difficult, we will step up our efforts to prosecute the illegal arms trade, especially on online marketplaces.
DE_M_006	1	Making solar roofs the standard
DE_M_006	2	We want an energy transition in which everyone can participate - tenants and homeowners alike.
DE_M_006	3	Our roofs, façades and balconies can become power stations - every surface with a solar system helps to protect the climate.
DE_M_006	4	The company's own electricity and heat energy is generated and used decentrally and locally.
DE_M_006	5	Our goal is 1.5 million new solar roofs in the next four years.
DE_M_006	6	That is why we will promote solar roofs and make them standard.
DE_M_006	7	Starting with new buildings, public and commercial buildings and roof renovations, we want to extend this new standard to existing buildings in the future.
DE_M_006	8	Leasing, rental and contracting models can provide support here.
DE_M_006	9	We will develop solutions for buildings that are particularly worthy of preservation.
DE_M_006	10	We will significantly simplify the tenant electricity regulations and promote tenant electricity projects.
DE_M_006	11	We want to remove bureaucratic hurdles to the use of electricity from your own roof and strengthen self-consumption and direct marketing.
DE_M_006	12	Photovoltaics in the countryside
DE_M_006	13	We want to bring photovoltaics not only to rooftops, but also to the countryside by improving the political and legal framework and facilitating construction.
DE_M_006	14	The expansion should preferably take place on sealed surfaces, such as above parking lots, next to highways and railways and on conversion or post-mining areas, and not on valuable farmland.
DE_M_006	15	We want to avoid new competition for land and focus on the multiple benefits for energy production, biodiversity and agriculture.
DE_M_006	16	Agri-photovoltaic systems, i.e. electricity production and agricultural or horticultural use on one area, can make an important contribution to climate protection and ecology.
DE_M_006	17	If you do it right, open space systems can become habitats.
DE_M_006	18	Farmers are to receive money for ecological services and thus generate additional income.
DE_M_006	19	It is also important to be able to conclude direct long-term electricity supply contracts.
DE_M_006	20	Citizens must be involved at an early stage in the planning process, and the municipalities must benefit from the proceeds
DE_M_006	21	Securing Germany as a business location with wind energy expansion
DE_M_006	22	We also need to make faster progress with wind power, for example by strengthening the expansion outside of tenders.
DE_M_006	23	When expanding wind farms, it is important to minimize conflicts with nature conservation and species protection, protect local residents and speed up approval procedures, including by reducing bureaucratic hurdles and creating clear framework conditions.
DE_M_006	24	As a first step, we want to define renewable energies as essential for security of supply and use 2 percent of the area nationwide for this purpose.
DE_M_006	25	All federal states must make their respective contributions to this.
DE_M_006	26	We reject plans to prevent this.
DE_M_006	27	Excessive, blanket minimum distances to settlements do nothing to increase acceptance.
DE_M_006	28	We ensure that the local community is involved at an early stage and that clear priority and
DE_M_006	29	The wind energy industry is also working to ensure a resident-friendly and nature-compatible choice of location with exclusion zones and targeted species protection programs, while at the same time strengthening the protection of birds and bats.
DE_M_006	30	We will speed up planning and approvals through simplified procedures, more staff and uniform assessment standards.
DE_M_006	31	We want to facilitate repowering so that old wind turbines at the same location can be quickly replaced by more powerful ones.
DE_M_006	32	We will enable systems over 20 years old to continue operating.
DE_M_006	33	We also want to support the construction of wind turbines in the immediate vicinity of industry and commerce in order to produce electricity where it is needed and where noise protection for local residents can be more easily guaranteed.
DE_M_006	34	We are further expanding our offshore parks and linking them in the European Energy Union with the solar parks of the Mediterranean states, with the hydropower of Scandinavia and the Alps.
DE_M_006	35	The more networked, the stronger.
DE_M_006	36	A continent is a good size for the energy transition.
DE_M_006	37	A green hydrogen strategy
DE_M_006	38	Hydrogen from renewable energies, so-called green hydrogen, is central to security of supply in a climate-neutral world.
DE_M_006	39	This is because hydrogen is easy to store and, if it is produced using electricity from renewable energies, it is also climate-friendly.
DE_M_006	40	Germany is far ahead when it comes to hydrogen production technologies.
DE_M_006	41	We want to further expand this leading role and create the corresponding infrastructure.
DE_M_006	42	With market incentives and a comprehensive funding program, we will create the capacities for hydrogen production in Germany.
DE_M_006	43	Even if green hydrogen is produced here as a priority, we will have to import hydrogen to meet demand.
DE_M_006	44	We must now establish the infrastructure for hydrogen imports.
DE_M_006	45	For imports, we will initiate and expand fair cooperation with wind and sun-rich countries and support exporting countries in the energy transition.
DE_M_006	46	For these partnerships to be successful, it is essential to involve the local population, protect human rights, align with the Sustainable Development Goals and introduce binding standards.
DE_M_006	47	For hydrogen to contribute to climate neutrality, it must be produced from renewable energies.
DE_M_006	48	This also applies to hydrogen imports.
DE_M_006	49	Our aim is to ensure that renewable energies are used efficiently and economically and that electrolysers are used to benefit the system.
DE_M_006	50	Hydrogen or synthetic fuels must not be part of a delaying tactic, but should actively contribute to climate neutrality.
DE_M_006	51	The direct use of electricity via batteries or heat pumps is generally much more efficient.
DE_M_006	52	It is therefore important to use hydrogen and synthetic fuels precisely where they are really needed: for example in industry, shipping or air traffic.
DE_M_014	1	Helping people in need, effectively organizing and managing migration
DE_M_014	2	The European Union and Germany help people who are in great need because they are politically persecuted or because of the Geneva Refugee Convention.
DE_M_014	3	We are committed to the fundamental right to asylum and the legal and humanitarian obligations of Germany and Europe.
DE_M_014	4	Targeted immigration is a gain and an opportunity for our country if it is accompanied by successful integration - into our labor market as well as into our society.
DE_M_014	5	This is what we expect from immigrants and we want to support them in this.
DE_M_014	6	The BioN-Tech founders are an impressive example of what successful immigration stories look like.
DE_M_014	7	They are just one of many examples that show how we can benefit from the brightest minds from around the world.
DE_M_014	8	This also applies to controlled and targeted immigration into the labor market.
DE_M_014	9	However, migration is only an opportunity if it takes place in an orderly manner and is based on clear rules.
DE_M_014	10	This applies to the immigration of skilled workers as well as to the admission of people seeking protection and refugees.
DE_M_014	11	We reject immigration into the social systems.
DE_M_014	12	Our policy is therefore characterized by an effective order and control of migration.
DE_M_014	13	This means that we do not want to enforce illegal migration and mandatory departures.
DE_M_014	14	This is the prerequisite for us to be able to help people in need in the long term.
DE_M_014	15	We combine cosmopolitanism and consistency, humanity and order.
DE_M_014	16	We have made asylum procedures and returns fairer, more structured and more efficient.
DE_M_014	17	We are continuing our efforts to ensure that the number of people fleeing to Germany and Europe not only remains permanently low, but continues to fall.
DE_M_014	18	To this end, a clear distinction must be made between people in need and those who have to leave our country because they are not in need of protection.
DE_M_014	19	We want to define further safe countries of origin.
DE_M_014	20	With the classification as a safe country of origin, citizens from such a country who apply for asylum in Germany can be returned to their home country more easily and quickly.
DE_M_014	21	Incentives would be reduced so that these people would not make their way to Germany without the prospect of asylum.
DE_M_014	22	Nevertheless, the classification of further countries with negligible recognition rates for asylum applications failed in the Bundesrat due to resistance from some federal states, although the Bundestag had already decided to extend this.
DE_M_014	23	"We therefore want to use the possibilities offered by European asylum law to create a new concept of safe countries of origin, the ""small"" safe country of origin."
DE_M_014	24	In an ordinary legislative procedure for the classification of a state, the state is classified as a safe country of origin within the meaning of both the Basic Law and the European Asylum Procedures Directive.
DE_M_014	25	"Classification as a ""small"" safe country of origin within the meaning of the Asylum Procedures Directive, on the other hand, would be possible without the approval of the Bundesrat and thus without the involvement of the federal states."
DE_M_014	26	This does not affect the examination for asylum guaranteed in the Basic Law in accordance with Art. 16a.
DE_M_014	27	We reject any extension of family reunification beyond the current regulations.
DE_M_014	28	We want to place greater restrictions on the right to stay for those obliged to leave the country in order to further reduce the incentives for illegal immigration; in particular, residence permits for tolerated persons should be linked to genuine integration requirements.
DE_M_014	29	We want to better enforce the obligation to leave the country and, among other things, create detention facilities at airports to facilitate collective deportations.
DE_M_014	30	Violations of a re-entry ban are immediately followed by detention pending deportation.
DE_M_014	31	We want to consistently deport criminals.
DE_M_014	32	Anyone who commits a criminal offense in Germany has forfeited their right as a guest.
DE_M_014	33	We will once again significantly increase the pressure on identity fraudsters and those who refuse to cooperate.
DE_M_014	34	To this end, we will expand the legal options and use available technical means.
DE_M_014	35	False statements in the asylum procedure must also be punishable in future if they are made to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.
DE_M_014	36	In addition, data carriers and in particular cell phones must also be allowed to be read to clarify security concerns.
DE_M_014	37	Anyone who deceives the state about their identity and prevents their deportation cannot be granted a tolerated stay, and we will also make the regulations on custody pending deportation and detention pending deportation more practicable.
DE_M_014	38	Fundamentally reform European asylum and refugee policy
DE_M_014	39	The care of people seeking protection is neither a challenge for Germany alone nor for the countries at the EU's external borders.
DE_M_014	40	It is a common European challenge.
DE_M_014	41	The primary goal must be to open up prospects for people in or near their home country.
DE_M_014	42	The European Union must further intensify cooperation with the main countries of origin and combat the causes of flight, such as poverty.
DE_M_014	43	In particular, this requires a comprehensive partnership with our neighbouring continent of Africa and an active stabilization policy in the Middle East.
DE_M_014	44	The Common European Asylum System must be fundamentally reformed.
DE_M_014	45	The European Commission's proposal for a fair and solidarity-based distribution of costs and burdens within the Member States of the European Union is a step in the right direction.
DE_M_014	46	We advocate the establishment of European-administered decision centers at the EU's external borders, where it should be possible to check whether or not a person is entitled to asylum.
DE_M_014	47	We need common standards in European asylum law and a Europe-wide harmonization of reception conditions - in terms of procedures, accommodation and care.
DE_M_014	48	This reduces the incentives that make some Member States more attractive to asylum seekers than others.
DE_M_017	1	Safeguarding the social market economy and strengthening the economy
DE_M_017	2	Germany's economy was already losing momentum before the coronavirus crisis.
DE_M_017	3	Now, despite the crisis, we need to get back on track for growth quickly.
DE_M_017	4	We need real impetus for modernization in order to create a future-proof location and jobs.
DE_M_017	5	We Free Democrats rely on the innovative power of the social market economy and on an agenda for more growth: unburden, unleash, invest.
DE_M_017	6	Back to a market economy - overcoming the consequences of coronavirus with growth
DE_M_017	7	We Free Democrats are calling for a return to market economy principles.
DE_M_017	8	Many have fallen into financial hardship through no fault of their own as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
DE_M_017	9	It was therefore right to launch aid programs, but the path towards more and more emergency aid and rescue packages for individual companies cannot be sustained.
DE_M_017	10	It is inefficient, distorts competition and reduces the competitiveness and innovative strength of both existing companies and start-ups.
DE_M_017	11	In addition, the market power of individual companies is growing, leading to less innovation and higher prices for consumers as well as false incentives for companies.
DE_M_017	12	We want to strengthen competition nationally and internationally and, in particular, avoid unnecessary interdependencies between the market economy and the state economy.
DE_M_017	13	We therefore support measures that apply equally to all companies, distort competition less and contribute to self-sustaining economic growth.
DE_M_017	14	European competition rules
DE_M_017	15	We Free Democrats want to protect and strengthen the fair and rules-based European competition regime and thus set international standards.
DE_M_017	16	On the one hand, this includes the fight against protectionism in the European single market.
DE_M_017	17	We want to simplify the EU Posting of Workers Directive and reduce bureaucracy in the German Posting of Workers Act.
DE_M_017	18	Secondly, we need better competitive conditions, particularly for young and medium-sized companies, especially in the digital economy.
DE_M_017	19	The concentration of market power on established and large companies hinders real competition and innovation.
DE_M_017	20	This is particularly detrimental to consumers and the future viability of the location.
DE_M_017	21	"We are therefore firmly opposed to the political promotion of ""national champions""."
DE_M_017	22	Such solo efforts within the European single market slow down innovation and scalability.
DE_M_017	23	This ultimately reduces the competitiveness of European companies compared to American and Chinese competitors.
DE_M_017	24	We see the social market economy as a learning system and as a model for an economic peace order - not only in Europe.
DE_M_017	25	Germany as an advocate of free trade
DE_M_017	26	We Free Democrats want Germany to become an international advocate of rules-based free trade and promote the conclusion of further free trade agreements.
DE_M_017	27	To this end, the German government must counter protectionist tendencies within Europe and the world and take an active leadership role in trade agreements, investment agreements and fair investment conditions.
DE_M_017	28	At the same time, it must drive forward the institutional anchoring of a rules-based free trade order.
DE_M_017	29	In order to give trade policy more weight in the next Federal Government, we are calling for a Minister of State for Foreign Trade.
DE_M_017	30	We also want to rename the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy as the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs, Free Trade and Energy.
DE_M_017	31	In order to maintain the European Union's ability to act in trade policy, we want to structure free trade agreements in such a way that - as with the EU-Japan agreement, for example - only the consent of the European Parliament is required, but not that of national and regional parliaments.
DE_M_017	32	We want to take action in the EU and worldwide against market distortions caused, for example, by heavily subsidized state-owned companies.
DE_M_017	33	We also advocate the principle of reciprocity, according to which companies should only have access to the European market if the reverse is also the case.
DE_M_017	34	Reforming the WTO - strengthening free trade
DE_M_017	35	We Free Democrats want to further develop the tried and tested framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
DE_M_017	36	The reform process must be transparent and inclusive.
DE_M_017	37	We reject national solo efforts and arbitrary tariffs as well as new non-tariff trade barriers.
DE_M_017	38	We are committed to resolving the blockade of WTO dispute settlement as quickly as possible.
DE_M_017	39	This also requires a new comprehensive round of negotiations in which a balance of interests between industrialized, emerging and developing countries is achieved.
DE_M_017	40	This round of negotiations must also include an evaluation of where WTO rules have not yet been effective in practice.
DE_M_017	41	We want subsidies and dumping to be combated wherever these practices hinder fair competition.
DE_M_017	42	Currently, this applies in particular to the construction of means of transportation such as trains, planes and ships.
DE_M_017	43	Establishment of a transatlantic economic area
DE_M_017	44	We Free Democrats want to achieve a new attempt at a comprehensive transatlantic free trade agreement and a transatlantic economic area.
DE_M_017	45	The EU free trade agreement with Canada (CETA), which was concluded in 2017 and should finally be ratified by Germany, could provide a blueprint.
DE_M_017	46	We also want to swiftly conclude and ratify the EU free trade agreement with Mercosur.
DE_M_020	1	A constitutional state capable of acting
DE_M_020	2	Extremism and terrorism are a threat to our democracy and our open and free society.
DE_M_020	3	The rule of law must therefore be better organized than crime.
DE_M_020	4	We need a constitutional state that is strong in action and enforcement and that guarantees security and freedom in equal measure.
DE_M_020	5	To this end, we Free Democrats want to better equip the police and judiciary, renew our security architecture and resolutely confront the enemies of the rule of law.
DE_M_020	6	Making criminal proceedings more effective, faster, more modern and more practical
DE_M_020	7	We Free Democrats want to make criminal proceedings more effective, faster, more modern and more practical - without this having a one-sided effect to the detriment of the rights of the accused and their defense.
DE_M_020	8	To this end, we want to fundamentally modernize the German criminal process, the basic structure of which dates back to the German Empire.
DE_M_020	9	The rule of law must also prove its ability to act in complex and exposed proceedings.
DE_M_020	10	The criminal process must
DE_M_020	11	become more digital and communicative.
DE_M_020	12	Interrogations and main hearings must be recorded in video and audio - this is the international standard.
DE_M_020	13	Main hearings could be conducted in a more concentrated and faster manner if the court could hold discussions with the defense and the public prosecutor's office about the structure of the proceedings.
DE_M_020	14	Federalism Reform III: Clear responsibilities in the security architecture
DE_M_020	15	We Free Democrats are calling for a Federalism Commission III of the federal and state governments.
DE_M_020	16	The commission is to submit proposals for a reform of the security architecture, for example by reducing the number of state offices for the protection of the constitution.
DE_M_020	17	Competencies, responsibilities and procedures must become clearer.
DE_M_020	18	Parliamentary control and data protection supervision must also be ensured in the cooperation platforms of the security authorities, in particular in the Joint Counter-Terrorism Center (GTAZ) and the Joint Counter-Extremism and Counter-Terrorism Center (GETZ).
DE_M_020	19	To this end, we are calling for a legal basis for these cooperation platforms that regulates the exchange of data between the authorities.
DE_M_020	20	We want to keep the tasks of the intelligence services and the police separate and enshrine this separation requirement in the Basic Law.
DE_M_020	21	Creating a European Crime Agency
DE_M_020	22	We Free Democrats call for Europol to be developed into a genuine European Criminal Police Office.
DE_M_020	23	Europol's own operational capabilities must be expanded.
DE_M_020	24	Terrorism, organized crime and cybercrime do not stop at national borders.
DE_M_020	25	The findings of the national security authorities on cross-border issues are to be jointly evaluated and operations of the member states coordinated.
DE_M_020	26	Danger definitions and databases must be standardized and compatible at European level.
DE_M_020	27	We also want to strengthen the European cyber security authority ENISA.
DE_M_020	28	Fighting organized crime
DE_M_020	29	We Free Democrats are committed to the sustainable fight against organized crime.
DE_M_020	30	The highly efficient and effective structures of organized crime in all its diverse forms must be countered by the state with appropriately structured and sustainable activities to protect the state and society.
DE_M_020	31	They must finally focus on the dark field of classic organized crime.
DE_M_020	32	Particularly in the area of organized white-collar crime, it must finally be possible to combat it on a regular basis.
DE_M_020	33	Internal leadership in the police
DE_M_020	34	"We Free Democrats advocate the creation of an ""Internal Leadership"" advisory board for the police, which should develop criteria for error culture and self-reflection in police work."
DE_M_020	35	The misconduct of individual civil servants, including the conditions that led to the misconduct, must be clarified.
DE_M_020	36	In this way, we want to strengthen trust in the police.
DE_M_020	37	The vast majority of police officers do an outstanding job.
DE_M_020	38	There must therefore be no general suspicion of our police.
DE_M_020	39	German police training is also particularly good by international standards.
DE_M_020	40	Scientific findings on radicalization, extremism and racism must nevertheless play a greater role in training, as must sensitivity to discrimination.
DE_M_020	41	We strongly condemn attacks on emergency services.
DE_M_020	42	We are therefore calling for better documentation of violence and assaults against police officers and other public service employees.
DE_M_020	43	Police actions must always be traceable, which is why we are calling for a pseudonymous identification requirement for officers.
DE_M_020	44	Better equipment and facilities for the police
DE_M_020	45	We Free Democrats are calling for better and functional staffing and equipment for the police.
DE_M_020	46	We want to provide the necessary resources and create the infrastructure for this.
DE_M_020	47	In particular, we want to use a digital pact to ensure that police officers in Germany are equipped with state-of-the-art technology and compatible IT infrastructures.
DE_M_020	48	Even the best laws are of no help if they cannot be enforced due to a lack of personnel, equipment or a dysfunctional IT infrastructure.
DE_M_020	49	In addition, we want to relieve the burden on police forces by reviewing their tasks.
DE_M_020	50	This includes examining whether tasks that are currently entrusted to the police can be carried out in full or in part by other government agencies - for example, property protection or the recording of traffic accidents.
DE_M_020	51	With the freed-up capacities, the police can devote themselves even more intensively to their core tasks and thus contribute to strengthening the rule of law.
DE_M_020	52	Weapons law with a sense of proportion and consistency
DE_M_020	53	We Free Democrats stand for firearms legislation with a sense of proportion and consistency.
DE_M_020	54	A strict distinction must be made between owners of legal weapons, such as marksmen and hunters, and illegal possession of weapons and possession of weapons by dangerous persons.
DE_M_020	55	The recent tightening of firearms legislation has burdened the owners of legal weapons, such as marksmen and hunters, with additional unnecessary bureaucracy.
DE_M_020	56	The federal government should undertake a general revision of firearms legislation in order to improve practicability and practicality.
DE_M_020	57	Dangerous people and extremists are not allowed to own weapons.
DE_M_020	58	To this end, the exchange of data between the authorities involved must be improved and the illegal arms trade must be combated more effectively at European level.
DE_M_026	1	Transforming the economy
DE_M_026	2	We must not carry on as before after the crisis.
DE_M_026	3	We want to make Europe fairer and promote a socio-ecological system change.
DE_M_026	4	We want the socio-ecological transformation to be possible in all Member States.
DE_M_026	5	Our goal is to make power generation, industry, transportation, buildings and agriculture climate-neutral without leaving people or regions behind (cf.
DE_M_026	6	"Chapter ""For a socio-ecological system change"")."
DE_M_026	7	The recent increase in the EU's greenhouse gas reduction target from 40 to 55 percent compared to 1990 is still too low to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.
DE_M_026	8	We want to make the EU climate-neutral by 2035 at the latest.
DE_M_026	9	Investments: The EU has cut the programs for a fair restructuring from 40 billion euros to 17.5 billion euros - the restructuring cannot succeed this way.
DE_M_026	10	We want to strengthen the Just Transition Fund.
DE_M_026	11	It is intended to help people working in sectors such as mining and climate-damaging industries, particularly in disadvantaged regions, to
DE_M_026	12	and open up new career prospects for them.
DE_M_026	13	In order to combat mass unemployment, poverty and a lack of prospects, a consistent European full employment policy and a genuine industrial strategy are needed.
DE_M_026	14	It must aim for climate neutrality and, above all, give deindustrialized regions a future.
DE_M_026	15	Energy transition: The coal phase-out must begin immediately across Europe and be completed by 2030.
DE_M_026	16	We do not want any new fossil fuel infrastructure.
DE_M_026	17	Renewable energies must be expanded - close to the people and in public or cooperative ownership.
DE_M_026	18	"We are committed to the establishment of an alternative ""European Community for the Promotion of Renewable Energies and Energy Saving""."
DE_M_026	19	We reject nuclear power and fracking.
DE_M_026	20	Transport revolution: A European mobility revolution is needed.
DE_M_026	21	This is possible if we expand bus and rail services and drastically reduce prices, create networked mobility and promote short distances.
DE_M_026	22	Instead of air routes, we want to expand rail connections.
DE_M_026	23	A large proportion of freight traffic and intra-European air traffic must be shifted to rail.
DE_M_026	24	Agricultural turnaround: We focus on sustainable agriculture and regional cycles instead of long transportation routes and industrial mass production.
DE_M_026	25	The system of EU agricultural subsidies is not sustainable; we want subsidies to be based on social and ecological criteria and no longer on area.
DE_M_026	26	We want to end export subsidies for agricultural products.
DE_M_026	27	For an economic awakening in the East
DE_M_026	28	The East has undergone enormous economic development over the past thirty years.
DE_M_026	29	However, the economic performance of the eastern countries still lags behind the western countries.
DE_M_026	30	Promising approaches that were already in place, such as the solar industry in eastern Germany, were destroyed by the CDU and its coalition partners by setting the wrong political course.
DE_M_026	31	Tens of thousands of jobs in an industry of the future have been recklessly put at risk.
DE_M_026	32	We rely on a regionally anchored economy that is geared towards the needs of the people in the respective regions.
DE_M_026	33	This also applies to agriculture.
DE_M_026	34	The East should no longer be the extended workbench of large West German corporations.
DE_M_026	35	DIE LINKE is committed to economic concepts based on the common good and cooperatives.
DE_M_026	36	Against the dominance of market-based exploitation and efficiency logic, we are committed to good care, public services of general interest and stopping the privatization of public property.
DE_M_026	37	Workers in East Germany have developed a new self-confidence in recent years.
DE_M_026	38	Many went on strike for better wages and working conditions.
DE_M_026	39	We stand in solidarity with workers and trade unions, especially in the labor disputes in
DE_M_026	40	East Germany and support them in the process.
DE_M_026	41	After reunification, the East lost its industrial base, including the processing and marketing of food.
DE_M_026	42	We now want to drive forward the reindustrialization of the East in order to create well-paid and secure jobs in the long term.
DE_M_026	43	We want to turn the East into a region of the future in which climate-friendly industrial jobs are created.
DE_M_026	44	We want to strengthen regional products, processing and distribution structures.
DE_M_026	45	Production cooperatives and sales cooperatives from the regions are to be linked together.
DE_M_026	46	We want a reindustrialization programme for the East.
DE_M_026	47	The aim is to promote the creation of climate-friendly industrial jobs throughout the east.
DE_M_026	48	Women are less frequently represented in management positions in business, science and politics.
DE_M_026	49	That has to change.
DE_M_026	50	That is why we are calling for a quota for women in management positions.
DE_M_026	51	positions of 50 percent and a greater sharing of management tasks and positions through job sharing or other working models (in contrast to the 30 percent quota of the Grand Coalition).
DE_M_029	1	Equal pay for equal work - what else?
DE_M_029	2	The persistence of unequal living conditions is not an accident of German unification, but a political choice.
DE_M_029	3	Instead of preventing low wages, the federal and state governments have used them to attract investors for decades.
DE_M_029	4	The result is corporate subsidiaries that exploit the differences between East and West, but do not eliminate them.
DE_M_029	5	Every third (!) employee in the eastern German states works in the low-wage sector.
DE_M_029	6	In the West, the figure is 16 percent.
DE_M_029	7	This has an impact on lower purchasing power, capital accumulation and pension entitlements.
DE_M_029	8	Half of full-time employees in the new federal states are threatened with a mini-pension, despite decades of work.
DE_M_029	9	A comparison of average gross salaries (2019) in eastern and western Germany showed a gross increase of 700 euros in the western pay packet.
DE_M_029	10	Every month.
DE_M_029	11	In Saxony-Anhalt, people work an average of 75 hours longer per year and receive almost
DE_M_029	12	3,000 euros less annual salary than in neighboring Lower Saxony.
DE_M_029	13	Almost 4 million people have emigrated from the East.
DE_M_029	14	This has massively increased structural ageing in the east.
DE_M_029	15	In the next few years, a huge wave of retirements will have to be compensated for in the eastern German states.
DE_M_029	16	This requires prospects, including for returnees and new immigrants.
DE_M_029	17	Equal pay for equal work with equal working hours for women and men, in East and West - that is our claim.
DE_M_029	18	The low-wage sector must be closed and the statutory minimum wage raised to 13 euros without delay.
DE_M_029	19	Employees in eastern Germany in particular would benefit from this.
DE_M_029	20	DIE LINKE is calling for a wage offensive in the east through more collective bargaining coverage and nationwide collective agreements in order to bring wages in the new federal states up to 100 percent to the level in the west by the end of the next legislative period in 2025.
DE_M_029	21	We want uniform pay zones in East and West.
DE_M_029	22	IG Bau has proven that wage harmonization is possible.
DE_M_029	23	The East-West wage wall can be overcome where trade unions are particularly influential.
DE_M_029	24	In comparable sectors, the same working hours and vacation regulations must apply nationwide.
DE_M_029	25	We want to make a minimum wage based on the lowest salary category of the collective agreement for the public service of the federal states (TVL) binding for the awarding of contracts.
DE_M_029	26	Working hours that fit your life!
DE_M_029	27	More staff instead of constant stress.
DE_M_029	28	We support the trade unions in their fight for a significant reduction in working hours towards a new standard employment relationship with 30 hours per week.
DE_M_029	29	We are committed to co-determination?
DE_M_029	30	right to staffing levels and an anti-stress regulation.
DE_M_029	31	Right to further training with social security!
DE_M_029	32	We are creating an entitlement to further training for all and securing income during periods of further training with a further training allowance.
DE_M_029	33	Expansion of employee and public co-determination in economic issues.
DE_M_029	34	Companies that make use of public aid may not simultaneously pay dividends to their shareholders or bonuses to board members.
DE_M_029	35	Wages that are enough for a good life.
DE_M_029	36	An end to low wages
DE_M_029	37	The statutory minimum wage is increased to 13 euros.
DE_M_029	38	Supplements for Sunday, shift or overtime work as well as special payments may not be offset against the minimum wage.
DE_M_029	39	All exceptions to the minimum wage must be abolished.
DE_M_029	40	Compliance with the minimum wage must be enforced through the obligation to record working hours electronically and more frequent checks.
DE_M_029	41	The number of inspectors in the customs' financial control of undeclared work must be doubled to15,000.
DE_M_029	42	The federal government should set up an official reporting portal against minimum wage fraud.
DE_M_029	43	Collective bargaining must apply to all Unter?
DE_M_029	44	companies and industries.
DE_M_029	45	To achieve this, the bargaining power of the trade unions must be strengthened and it must be easier to declare collective agreements generally binding.
DE_M_029	46	The latter must be possible at the request of a party to the collective agreement.
DE_M_029	47	"The employers' right of veto in the collective bargaining committee should be abolished and it must be considered in the ""public interest"" to strengthen the scope of collective agreements and prevent undercutting competition at the expense of wages and working conditions."
DE_M_029	48	In addition, it should also be possible to extend complete pay tables regulated in collective agreements to companies not bound by collective agreements by means of a statutory order in accordance with the Posted Workers Act.
DE_M_029	49	All collective agreements that have been declared generally binding - even if only for a regional area of application - must also apply to employees temporarily posted to Germany.
DE_M_029	50	End wage dumping through work contracts and temporary work.
DE_M_029	51	We want to ban temporary work.
DE_M_029	52	Until temporary work is banned, temporary workers must receive the same wages as permanent employees plus a flexibility bonus of 10 percent from day one.
DE_M_029	53	The awarding of contracts for work and the use of temporary work must be
DE_M_029	54	be subject to the approval of the works council and compliance with the collective agreements applicable in the core company.
DE_M_029	55	To prevent the abuse of work contracts, the burden of proof must lie with employers in future.
DE_M_029	56	The Temporary Employment Act must be linked to the workplace rather than to the individual employee.
DE_M_029	57	Employment agencies and job centers must stop forcing the unemployed into such undignified working conditions.
DE_M_029	58	We want a legal entitlement to a full-time position.
DE_M_029	59	In order to enforce equal pay for women and men, the right to information in the Pay Transparency Act must be supplemented by a right to take action against associations.
DE_M_029	60	Trade unions must be able to sue for equal pay for their members.
DE_M_029	61	In the event of transfers to companies not bound by collective agreements and in the event of outsourcing, the existing collective agreements in their current version must remain protected indefinitely and also apply to new employees.
DE_M_033	1	No to mass immigration and welcome policies
DE_M_033	2	With the Marrakesh Pact on Migration, the UN wanted to introduce a set of rules almost unnoticed that would penalize countries that do not promote migration or are even critical of it.
DE_M_033	3	Various media outlets that report critically on the migration issue, for example, should be deprived of support.
DE_M_033	4	However, with the FPÖ in the federal government, Austria did not agree to this agreement.
DE_M_033	5	Otherwise, the pact would also have become binding for us under customary international law and we would no longer be able to decide for ourselves who is allowed to immigrate to Austria.
DE_M_033	6	EU tolerates illegal immigration and people smuggling
DE_M_033	7	German politicians are inviting streams of refugees into their country and then want to divide them up across Europe.
DE_M_033	8	With their behavior, they have clearly violated applicable EU law in the form of
DE_M_033	9	"""Dublin III"" violated."
DE_M_033	10	On the other hand, countries that have adhered to this and protect their borders, such as Hungary, are treated with hostility.
DE_M_033	11	NGO ships cooperate with tugboats.
DE_M_033	12	They bring boat passengers to Europe and not to the nearby African coast.
DE_M_033	13	This is not about rescue operations, but about smuggling tolerated by the EU.
DE_M_033	14	Left-wing romanticism is not a solution
DE_M_033	15	Former SPÖ Chancellor Werner Faymann, for example, is unforgotten.
DE_M_033	16	"""Door with side panels"" wanted to protect."
DE_M_033	17	"However, left-wing romanticism and the slogan ""We can do it"" are not the solution."
DE_M_033	18	The consequences are, for example, a justice system with overcrowded prisons and overburdened courts as well as the total overloading of the police force with thousands of hours of overtime.
DE_M_033	19	But schools and the social and healthcare systems have also reached the limits of their capacity.
DE_M_033	20	Asylum is only temporary protection
DE_M_033	21	In view of these conditions, the FPÖ clearly states: asylum is temporary protection and not a cover for economic refugees.
DE_M_033	22	Poverty and climate change are not grounds for asylum.
DE_M_033	23	Once the reason for asylum no longer applies, you must return to your country of origin!
EL_005	1	In fact, he insists
EL_005	2	It is difficult to describe the onslaught of a pandemic and its impact on the global community or Russia's decision to invade Ukraine and the international upheavals
EL_005	3	Yesterday, Russian troops withdrew from Cherson, on the west bank of the Dnieper.
EL_005	4	Today international analysts are trying to analyse the move and see through Putin's eyes.
EL_005	5	A few hours ago the US Democrats saved the day in the midterm elections, Trump's lost ground in the Republican field and Biden is preparing for a fresh start; has he learned his lesson and how will he move on to the next tune?
EL_005	6	At the same time, the European community is trying to prove that it is not a slow boat, looking for a corner in the trough of gas and the energy crisis.
EL_005	7	Preparing for an unprecedentedly harsh winter - what if yesterday's news from Hersonissos was indeed welcome? It may be extremely difficult to predict what will happen in the next minute in the global sphere; but it is possible and necessary to prepare for all the good and bad scenarios that each circumstance carries on its back.
EL_005	8	One thing that both the government and the opposition have agreed on for months is the need to tame poverty, how to protect the country's citizens and especially the vulnerable households, which have increased during the years of the memoranda and have been slapped by the pandemic and the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
EL_005	9	Politicians are there to predict, to make policy and to implement it when they are at the helm of the country.
EL_005	10	Yes, obviously the opposition disagrees with the government's plan in the face of crises and problems; it is its responsibility, after all, to criticise them harshly, to make proposals and to insist on bringing them to the fore.
EL_005	11	The wiretapping case needs a lot of light and clear answers; it needs action, not words.
EL_005	12	We are facing an already prolonged election period, where everyone (in politics) has to prove who they are, what they can do and how they will achieve it.
EL_005	13	In any case, this winter will not be a walk in the sunshine.
EL_005	14	"Accuracy is here and the ""household basket"" is a move that is just beginning to be tested."
EL_005	15	Indicative of the situation are the remarks of the INE of the GSEE that show that since April until today the minimum wage has lost 19% of its purchasing power.
EL_005	16	In 2022, with inflation running at around 10%, the losses are greater for lower incomes.
EL_005	17	It is at 40% for households with a monthly income of up to 750 euros, 9-14% for households with an income of 751-1,100 euros, decreasing as income increases.
EL_005	18	What is also recorded among other things is that the distribution of income is changing to the detriment of wage labour.
EL_005	19	"It is a ""picture"" that must be changed - and it can be changed, not by ""predictions"", but by a plan and drastic measures every time."
EL_005	20	With constant checks and constant modifications of any plan; why not by adopting proposals coming from the opposition side?
EL_010	1	09:33 Summit on drones and eVTOL
EL_010	2	The White House will hold a conference tomorrow, Wednesday, involving top officials on advanced air mobility, including unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, a spokesman confirmed.
EL_010	3	The conference, organised by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), will be attended by NASA Director Bill Nelson, US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acting Administrator Billy Nolen and Joby Aviation CEO Joben Bevirt.
EL_010	4	"It will examine ""the future of civil aviation in the US and the regulatory strategy for responsible and equitable adoption of these technologies""."
EL_010	5	At the same event, the White House said, the event will analyse how advanced air mobility (AAM) can help achieve domestic policy, national security, climate and job creation goals in the US.
EL_010	6	"It will also examine ""the future of civil aviation in America and the regulatory strategy for responsible and equitable adoption of these technologies,"" as well as the challenges of integrating unmanned aerial vehicles and eVTOL aircraft into US national airspace."
EL_010	7	Speakers also include Gary Button, leader of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Alondra Nelson, acting director of OSTP, and White House Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Josh Geltzer.
EL_010	8	The conference comes as the White House is pushing Congress to expand the government's powers to detect and neutralize aerial drones.
EL_010	9	This extension of powers is scheduled to expire in October.
EL_010	10	At the same conference, US National Football League (NFL) security chief Kathy Lanier will take part, along with officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.
EL_010	11	"On July 14, the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NCAA and NASCAR sent a joint letter to Congress supporting the Biden Administration's proposal to expand authority over the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, stating that the expansion of authority ""would have an important role in the safety of major sporting events, including the safety of the millions of American fans who take part in these events each year."""
EL_010	12	Officially registered drones in the US exceed 800,000.
EL_010	13	Since 2018, the FBI has conducted 70 operations using drones, as well as drone protection operations against drones identified as threats, at major events such as the Super Bowl, which is the most important and popular annual game in the sport of American football.
EL_014	1	Russia: Disconnecting enemies and rewarding friends in the market reset
EL_014	2	Friends and enemies.
EL_014	3	From Monday, the Moscow Stock Exchange will allow trading to investors whose countries are not involved in sanctions against Russia, ending the ban that had been in place since the war.
EL_014	4	"For ""non-friendly"" countries, however, the ban remains in place."
EL_014	5	"""Initially it was a kind of capital controls necessary to stabilize the situation."
EL_014	6	"But now it's more a matter of principle for the Russians,"" explains Christopher Granville, general manager at TS Lombard in London, to Bloomberg."
EL_014	7	"It is yet another weapon to be added to the energy war and the ""drop in the ocean"" with natural gas."
EL_014	8	It is the latest example of Russia taking an increasingly hard line between friend and foe, the article notes.
EL_014	9	It also notes that Russia's sovereign wealth fund can now invest in the currencies of nations such as China, India and Turkey, after sanctions blocked the euro and dollar markets.
EL_014	10	"Given the circumstances... ""Given the circumstances, it will be necessary to develop trade and economic relations with those countries that are ready to do so with Russia,"" said Oleg Vyugin, a former top Russian central bank and finance ministry official."
EL_014	11	The article points out, among other things, that the economy emerged as a new front against Russia almost immediately after Putin ordered his army to invade Ukraine on February 24.
EL_014	12	To punish the Kremlin, foreign governments imposed sanctions on trade and banking, froze about half of the central bank's reserves and cut many of its banks off from the global SWIFT messaging system.
EL_014	13	Unable to intervene to defend the ruble with yuan and gold alone, the central bank imposed capital controls and other emergency measures to calm investors.
EL_014	14	New normal.
EL_014	15	But Russia is turning the page now that domestic markets appear to have weathered the storm, Bloomberg notes.
EL_014	16	Unexpected energy revenues and a collapse in imports helped the ruble to recover, allowing the authorities to lift restrictions on capital controls.
EL_014	17	Local bond yields return to pre-war levels.
EL_014	18	Policy makers are looking inward looking for sources of funding.
EL_014	19	"Other proposals, as Bloomberg points out, among others, aim to discourage businesses from using ""toxic"" currencies and state-owned companies would have to convert their foreign currency into currencies of ""friendly"" countries, according to the central bank."
EL_014	20	However, even as some investors gain greater access to domestic markets, it is also a reminder of the challenges ahead, Bloomberg points out.
EL_016	1	Freedom will win, Zelenski told the British Parliament
EL_016	2	Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his and the Ukrainian people's thanks for their continued support against the Russian invader and their confidence that his country will win, in a historic speech at Westminster Hall before British MPs and Lords.
EL_016	3	The Ukrainian President said that London had supported his country from the first day of the full invasion, when the rest of the world had not understood how to react.
EL_016	4	Addressing former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he thanked him for uniting the others when it seemed impossible.
EL_016	5	He praised the determination and strong character of the British, who, he said, with their bravery in helping Ukraine, did not compromise their country's values.
EL_016	6	Zelenski drew a parallel between the war with Russia and the British resistance to Nazism.
EL_016	7	We will always overcome evil, he said.
EL_016	8	He added that as in World War II, we know that freedom will win, we know that Russia will lose and we know that our victory will change the world.
EL_016	9	He added that the world needs British leadership and Ukrainian bravery and called for continued assistance from the coalition of friends, which will be necessary to prevent future aggression in other parts of the country.
EL_016	10	He praised this G7 coalition of air defence, sanctions and values and thanked Britain for the preparatory work to set up a special court for the crime of Russian aggression and to create a special reparations mechanism.
EL_016	11	He also thanked the British government for sending tanks and long-range missiles, which, he said, would help to force Russia into full retreat.
EL_016	12	He called again for fighter jets to be given to Ukraine by Britain and the West, calling them wings for freedom.
EL_016	13	He presented the President of the House of Commons with the helmet of a Ukrainian fighter pilot.
EL_016	14	President Zelenski was welcomed by the members of both houses of the British Parliament to a standing ovation.
EL_016	15	Earlier, he had a meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Shunak in Downing Street.
EL_016	16	Mr Shunak told the House at lunchtime that the UK hoped for a Ukrainian victory later this year.
EL_016	17	Later, the two leaders will visit a British training ground for Ukrainian soldiers and then the Ukrainian President will be received by King Charles.
EL_016	18	As he told the MPs and Lords, he intends to tell the King that while in Britain the King is an Air Force pilot, in Ukraine every Air Force pilot is a King.
EL_021	1	Frederick University is the only university in Cyprus that coordinates Capacity Development projects in higher education
EL_021	2	Frederick University has been awarded three European Erasmus+ projects of the Action for Capacity Building in Higher Education for the period 2019-2022.
EL_021	3	Frederick University was the only institution in Cyprus where proposals for this action were approved as a coordinating institution.
EL_021	4	Frederick University was also among the three universities that succeeded in having three proposals approved, out of 147 proposals approved out of a total of 874 proposals submitted by universities in more than 100 countries.
EL_021	5	During the EU conference organised in Brussels for all new projects of the Erasmus+ CBHE Grantholder's Meeting, the RefTeCp project on the development of a Programme for the Accreditation of Teaching Competences of Egyptian and Refugee Teachers through a Training System Combining Lifelong and Distance Learning , was selected together with 4 other out of 147 projects to be presented by its coordinator as one of the best examples of projects approved.
EL_021	6	The coordinator of all three projects is Professor Vassilios Makrakis of the Department of Education at Frederick University.
EL_021	7	The programmes are the following: 1.
EL_021	8	ICTeEfS In-service Training of Teachers in Education for Sustainable Development supported by Information and Communication Technologies.
EL_021	9	This project is aimed at building the capacity of practicing teachers and lecturers in pedagogical departments with the support of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.
EL_021	10	In the framework of the project, innovative teaching and learning approaches oriented towards sustainability education will be developed with the participation of academics from the Departments of Education, ICT coordinators and primary and secondary school teachers.
EL_021	11	The project falls within the national priorities of these countries to promote sustainability education issues in both teacher training curricula and primary and secondary school curricula. 2.
EL_021	12	RefTeCp : Development of a Certification Programme for the Teaching Competences of Egyptian and Refugee Teachers through a Training System Combining Lifelong and Distance Learning.
EL_021	13	This project aims to develop the teaching skills of participating teachers in four Egyptian Universities to address the learning, psycho-social and other needs of children and young people of refugee origin.
EL_021	14	For the implementation of the project, innovative actions and training materials will be developed for the training of both Egyptian and refugee teachers.
EL_021	15	The project is expected to have a significant impact considering the scale of the refugee crisis. 3.
EL_021	16	PUAT : Professionalisation of Undergraduate Academic Teaching in Various University Faculties for the Integration of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
EL_021	17	This programme focuses on the development and certification of teaching competencies of academics with a view to integrating the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in South African universities.
EL_021	18	Given the strategic importance of quality teaching and curriculum design at undergraduate level, this programme will create the conditions for the successful implementation of the South African National Strategy for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
EL_021	19	This success follows the University's successful involvement in European programmes involving partnerships with third countries, such as Erasmus Mundus, Tempus and Capacity Building in Higher Education, highlighting the extroversion of the organisation and its academic community, as well as their proven ability to play a leading role in the transfer of know-how and regional development of partnerships in higher education.
EL_021	20	The total budget of the three projects amounts to €2.6 million and involves 24 universities, mainly from the target countries.
EL_022	1	Get an in-depth understanding of Logistics and Supply Chain Management
EL_022	2	Nowadays, in an increasingly Internet-driven market, logistics and Supply Chain Management mean much more than just managing warehouses and inventory.
EL_022	3	Logistics are all the functions of a company in order to have available in a suitable time and quantity the products necessary for its production, but also to serve its customers.
EL_022	4	Larger companies have already realised this and see logistics more as a part of marketing and sales, rather than a function around inventory and transport management.
EL_022	5	The thinking is simple: when a customer - wherever they are - can get the product they need (in the right size or with the right specifications) in the shortest possible time, then a relationship of loyalty and long-term commitment is built with the company.
EL_022	6	That is the point, after all.
EL_022	7	The most competitive companies both in Greece and globally consider high quality logistics to be their comparative advantage and systematically apply performance measurements.
EL_022	8	This is exactly the need that the Bachelor of Science in Logistics and Supply Chain Management of Deree - The American College of Greece answers.
EL_022	9	The characteristics of the curriculum.
EL_022	10	Deree's curriculum equips students with a deep knowledge of the subject and an understanding of the aspects of logistics and supply chain management in the spirit of modern business.
EL_022	11	The programme is designed for students interested in the challenges and opportunities of designing, operating and improving supply networks, as well as for those who wish to pursue a career in a variety of related corporate structures.
EL_022	12	The course programme includes topics ranging from Economics and Law to Research and Statistics and from basic principles of marketing and Business Administration to an introductory approach to People Management and Decision Making.
EL_022	13	The focus is on courses related to logistics and Supply Chain Management, such as: Introduction to Supply Chain Management & Administration, Transportation Systems, Information Flows, Financial Flows and Risk Management in Supply Networks, Total Quality Management, Project Management, Supply Chain Management, Export Strategy and Management, Business Negotiations, Maritime Freight and International Trade Law, Retail and Supply Chain Management.
EL_022	14	The curriculum is completed with practical training in logistics and supply chain management.
EL_022	15	Students have access to a number of companies that cooperate with Deree - The American College of Greece in order to implement their internship and prepare for their next professional step.
EL_022	16	The comparative advantages of Deree.
EL_022	17	The Bachelor of Science in Logistics and Supply Chain Management at Deree - The American College of Greece is a degree program that has been developed with the input of leading private sector employers, ensuring that the studies will meet the real needs of the market.
EL_022	18	Furthermore, Deree's curriculum cultivates high-level knowledge and skills that are applicable to a broader business field related to logistics and supply chain management.
EL_022	19	As a result, Deree students have immediate professional rehabilitation and incomparably more career options.
EL_022	20	At the same time, the Bachelor of Science in Logistics and Supply Chain Management of Deree - The American College of Greece is a very good preparation for postgraduate studies.
EL_022	21	Through this programme, Deree students can obtain an American degree, based on the NECHE (New England Commission on Higher Education) accreditation for Deree - The American College of Greece, as well as a UK degree awarded by the Open University (OU) based on the College's partnership with the OU.
EL_028	1	"Loverdos distances himself from Fofi - ""PASOK must do responsible opposition"""
EL_028	2	The climate in the Movement for Change is still heavy, after the sudden decision of Fofi Gennimata to remove Andreas Loverdos from the position of parliamentary representative and place Kostas Skandalidis in his place.
EL_028	3	This decision by the president of Kinal was linked to rumours that Andreas Loverdos was determined to contest the leadership of the party at the next congress, scheduled for the autumn.
EL_028	4	The removal of Andreas Loverdos was also commented that it reflects the intention of Fofi Gennimata to bring Kinal closer to SYRIZA.
EL_028	5	It is also known that Andreas Loverdos is one of the members of Kinal who is opposed to any alliance with SYRIZA, unlike Kostas Skandalidis who was appointed to his position.
EL_028	6	In his first statement after his suspension, the Kinal MP called nonsense about his irritation and added that he wants to see Kinal more than double its forces.
EL_028	7	"""When you're a kid, the first thing they tell you is 'who you're going with,'"" he noted."
EL_028	8	"In an article in Nea Svetakiriako, Andreas Loverdos distances himself from the Southwest and SYRIZA (which he describes as a party of ""populism and demagogy"") and calls on PASOK to be a responsible opposition and not to leave the field of reforms open to the Southwest."
EL_028	9	A kind of warning to Fofi Gennimata not to follow SYRIZA's steps towards populism, but to promote the party's reformist profile.
EL_028	10	"Andreas Loverdos writes, under the title ""The bet that PASOK has no right to lose."
EL_028	11	PASOK's dominant position after the post-independence period is largely due to its literal monopoly of the field of reforms.
EL_028	12	Today, from the position of opposition that the electorate has given us, we have the opportunity and at the same time the obligation to promote, honour or at least not destroy the reformist dna of our party in the decades to come.
EL_028	13	"Because it is always important in politics where we are today, I think it is appropriate to point out that the term ""reform"" defines not the one who preaches it but the one who carries it out."
EL_028	14	And that is precisely why I am deeply convinced that reforms are a privileged field, mainly, not to say exclusively, for the PASOK-Movement for Change party.
EL_028	15	As an absolute indication, I mention the local government of all levels, the NHS, the EOPYY, the Ombudsman, the electronic prescription, the ASEP, etc.etc.etc.etc.
EL_028	16	In this sense, the effort of the present government and especially of Prime Minister Mitsotakis to usurp and secure reform exclusivities appears rather unrealistic.
EL_028	17	Our party, PASOK-Movement for Change, should not do New Democracy any favours and leave the reform space free.
EL_028	18	Opposition waiting for the government to articulate A to gurgle from the O side is as easy as it is useless and dangerous for the people.
EL_028	19	The Greek people need a responsible opposition to a government that, for better or worse, the people have voted for, an opposition that will reveal the government's inadequacies, the discrepancies between the titles and the content of its policies and will try to improve the situation of the country and to tackle poverty, which will be the big issue after the pandemic.
EL_028	20	Greeks need more than ever a party that will instil with its stance the hope and certainty that there is a pair of safe hands on the opposition benches that protects and shields their interests.
EL_028	21	In the present time, Mitsotakis feels very comfortable with Tsipras precisely because the latter chooses, as always, the path of populism and demagogy.
EL_028	22	But as long as these two are comfortable with each other, the citizen waits.
EL_028	23	PASOK-Movement for Change must respond to this demand.
EL_028	24	In order to achieve this, the main condition is to more than double its share of the vote.
EL_028	25	This must be our goal as a party of the Centre, of the Centre-Left and of Social Democracy, so that we can be the reformist opposition that society needs and that will make our party great again.
EL_028	26	By force of example: let each of us consider what we want in terms of vaccination.
EL_028	27	"Cockfighting with no tomorrow or a substantial contribution to its acceleration? This is the universal demand of society and this is the bet that PASOK has no right to lose."""
EL_033	1	Who took the reins of the richest family on the planet
EL_033	2	One can often see Sheikh Mansour high in the stands at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium, receiving the adulation of the fans like a benevolent monarch as they acknowledge the role his family's wealth played in propelling their team to the top of the Premier League.
EL_033	3	As the Sunday Times reports, the Al Nahyan family, of which Mansour, 52, is a prominent scion, now occupies the top of another table: by dethroning the Waltons of Walmart for the first time, they have become the richest family in the world.
EL_033	4	According to the most recent Bloomberg index, the family's net worth is now at least $300 billion.
EL_033	5	The Al Nahyan from Abu Dhabi are one of the six leading families of the United Arab Emirates.
EL_033	6	Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, 61, also known as MBZ, is the ruler of Abu Dhabi.
EL_033	7	This year he was elected president of the Emirates, following the death of his half-brother, Sheikh Khalifa.
EL_033	8	While the foundation of the family's fortune is the vast oil reserves of the Arabian Peninsula, careful investments in everything from sports teams and London real estate to Rihanna's lingerie line, fast-food companies and Ilon Musk's SpaceX have catapulted the family to even greater wealth.
EL_033	9	The value of her investment company, International Holding Co (IHC), has increased by almost 28,000% in the last five years.
EL_033	10	Although Mohammed and Mansour are the most prominent members of the family, it is their brother, 53-year-old Sheikh Takhnun, who controls much of the financial empire.
EL_033	11	He heads Abu Dhabi's investment fund ADQ, as well as the country's leading bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank.
EL_033	12	A black belt in jiu-jitsu, he is also a national security adviser to the Emirates.
EL_033	13	He often books business in his supergiant.
EL_033	14	The family owns at least three, including Azzam, the largest privately owned yacht in the world.
EL_033	15	At the heart of the Al Nahyan fortune is the Royal Group, a network of companies that employs more than 27,000 people in sectors from finance to robotics and has assets worth nearly $300 billion, Bloomberg sources said.
EL_033	16	In addition to investing in a wide range of companies, the group also acts on behalf of the family, bringing in world-class chefs to cook for them and hiring personal bodyguards.
EL_033	17	Bloomberg sources note that despite the family's meteoric success, foreign investors are reluctant to invest money in its companies as they are concerned about transparency.
EL_033	18	"In its latest annual report on its accounts, the auditing firm Ernst & Young stated that IHC's financial statements were subject to an audit of ""significantly less scope"" than the audits required by international standards."
EL_033	19	The fortunes of the top. 1.
EL_033	20	Al Nahyan family - estimated fortune of $300 billion : Their financial interests include stakes in Manchester City, Ilon Musk's SpaceX and Rihanna's fashion company Savage X Fenty.
EL_033	21	Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed is president of the United Arab Emirates. 2.
EL_033	22	Walton family - $224.5 billion: Sam Walton founded Walmart in Arkansas in 1962.
EL_033	23	In 2021 it was the largest company in the world in terms of revenue.
EL_033	24	Walton's children, Jim, Alice and Rob Walton, currently have a fortune of $65 billion each. 3.
EL_033	25	Mars family - 160 billion dollars: The candy company founded by Frank Mars is today better known for its M&Ms than its namesake chocolate.
EL_033	26	Marsh's great-grandchildren are among the people currently running the company. 4.
EL_033	27	Koch family - $128.8 billion: Frederick, Charles, David and William inherited the oil company of their father, Fred, but, after a dispute over control of the company in the early 1980s, Frederick and William left the business.
EL_033	28	It has since become a conglomerate with annual revenues of around $125 billion.
EL_033	29	Charles and David - both of whom passed away in 2019 - donated hundreds of millions of dollars to bring experimental ideas to the forefront of American politics. 5.
EL_033	30	Al Saud family - $105 billion: Saudi Arabia's royal family includes up to 15,000 members and has a history in the monarchy that goes back almost a century.
EL_033	31	Its ties to Saudi Aramco, a giant in the oil industry, ensure that the family will continue to accumulate wealth.
EL_035	1	Agony for the missing Erietta - No DNA match for relatives...
EL_035	2	Agony continues to prevail for 23-year-old Erietta, an architecture student, whose traces are missing after the accident in Tempi.
EL_035	3	At the moment, 56 dead have been identified and only one case of biological material, taken from a relative of Henrietta, has not been matched.
EL_035	4	According to the head of the forensic service in Larissa, Rubini Leontari, the service has no clue.
EL_035	5	The temperature that developed, according to the fire department's information, at the point where the flame was white, was about 1,000-1,100 degrees Celsius.
EL_035	6	So you can understand that whoever was found at that point may or may not be found, he told OPEN.
EL_035	7	24 hours ago and following a complaint from the family, Ms.
EL_035	8	"Leontari had noted the following: ""We do not yet have a body that matches the DNA of the family."
EL_035	9	If it was in the center of the very large fire, clearly it could have been missed.
EL_046	1	Shocking figures on the gap between rich and poor
EL_046	2	"The world's 2,153 billionaires now have more money than 60% of the world's population, the non-governmental organisation Oxfam denounces in a report released today, stressing that the concentration of wealth is taking place at the expense of women above all, ""at the forefront"" of inequalities."
EL_046	3	"""The gap between rich and poor"" is an issue that ""cannot be resolved without well thought-out policies against inequalities."
EL_046	4	"Governments must guarantee that businesses and the rich pay their fair share of taxes,"" said Amitabh Bihar, Oxfam's Managing Director in India, who will represent the NGO at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year."
EL_046	5	Oxfam's annual report on global inequalities was released - as is the NGO's custom - ahead of the opening of the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, tomorrow, Tuesday.
EL_046	6	It is the rendezvous of the world's economic and political elite, which comes after a year of uprisings, great movements of social demands, from Chile to the Middle East and France.
EL_046	7	"""Vulgar inequalities are at the heart of ruptures and social conflicts everywhere in the world (...) It is not an accident, (but) it is the result of policies (...) which reduce the participation of the richest in social solidarity through taxation and weaken the financing of public services"", stressed Pauline Leclair, spokesperson of the French branch of Oxfam."
EL_046	8	According to the data of the NGO, whose methodology is based on data published in the financial magazine Forbes and made public by the bank Crédit Suisse - some economists question it - 2,153 people now have more money in their hands than the 4.6 billion poorest people on the planet.
EL_046	9	"Moreover, the wealth of the 1%, the richest citizens of the world, ""corresponds to more than twice the aggregate wealth"" of the 6.9 billion less wealthy people around the world, according to Oxfam, which describes this concentration of wealth as ""unimaginable""."
EL_046	10	"""Women are at the forefront of inequalities because of an economic system that discriminates against them and drives them into the most precarious and poorly paid jobs, starting with the care sector,"" insisted Leclair."
EL_046	11	"According to NGO estimates, 42% of the world's women cannot find paid work, ""due to the enormous burden of caring at the personal and family level"", while the same can be said for only 6% of men."
EL_046	12	"From the household to the kitchen, to the harvesting of wood, to the search for water in southern countries, ""the monetary value of the unpaid care work provided by women aged 15 and over is equivalent to 10.8 trillion dollars a year, three times the value of the IT and digital services sector on a global scale"", the NGO stresses."

EL_046	14	Half of the country's wealth is concentrated in the hands of the richest 10% of the French.
EL_046	15	It is also significant that 22 billionaires have more in their hands than all the women in Africa combined.

EL_055	1	Varvitsiotis: EU and US do not accept Turkey as an autonomous geopolitical power
EL_055	2	Deputy Foreign Minister Miltiades Varvitsiotis expressed the view that the US and the EU do not accept Turkey in the role of an autonomous geopolitical power as pursued by Tayyip Erdogan.
EL_055	3	He plays a la carte with the rules.
EL_055	4	"""Turkey and Mr Erdogan have decided to play a different role in the international arena."
EL_055	5	"They want to be accepted as an autonomous geopolitical power that can play by the rules a la carte. ""This cannot be accepted by the EU, nor does it foster a climate of stability in Turkey's traditional ally and our own ally, the United States,"" the deputy foreign minister said, speaking to the radio station ""Tema 104.6""."
EL_055	6	"Referring to exploratory contacts, Mr Varvitsiotis stressed that Greece wants there to be scope for dialogue with Turkey and to lower the tone of provocativeness, noting that our country's aim is ""to make Turkey the subject of European discussions so that Greek-Turkish relations are seen in the light of Euro-Turkish relations and not as a bilateral problem""."
EL_055	7	Great disbelief.
EL_055	8	He also notes that in the European Council, Turkey is the item on which there is the greatest discussion and the greatest preparation among the leaders, while referring to the difficulties of the exploratory contacts between Ankara and Athens, Mr.
EL_055	9	"Varvitsiotis points out that ""for better or worse, cooperation is not easy, there is too much mistrust and too much tension since we see that every time we come to the exploratory contacts we hear some reasons for aggravation and provocativeness from the Turkish side""."
EL_055	10	Euro-Turkish issue.
EL_055	11	"The Deputy Foreign Minister notes that ""since August, the permanent issue in the European Councils has been Turkey's behaviour and the de-escalation in the Eastern Mediterranean, showing that it cannot see it as a bilateral issue in which it can play the game of easy provocations."
EL_055	12	"An internationalisation of the issue raises the cost of any involvement. ""The fact that it becomes Euro-Turkish also raises the economic cost of any aggressive policy on the part of Turkey."
EL_055	13	"To provoke any incident is something that is now weighing on the Turkish authorities...which no one can rule out, but it is the option that seems to be the first on the table."""
EL_055	14	Referring to the upcoming EU Leaders' Summit, Mr.
EL_055	15	"Varvitsiotis stresses that ""the fact that we are going from one European Council to another and discussing the issue of Turkey makes Greece a central player in this framework of decisions that concern the whole of Europe""."
EL_062	1	Mr Mitsotakis: In Bulgaria today for the IGB pipeline
EL_062	2	The role of Greece as an energy bridge between the South and the North, the Balkans and Europe, the upgrading of our country on the energy and geopolitical map and its role in the energy security and supply of the wider region, The opening ceremony of the commercial operation of the Greece-Bulgaria gas interconnector (IGB) in Sofia today, which will be attended and addressed by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, will mark a critical juncture.
EL_062	3	In addition to the Greek Prime Minister, the leaders of the other countries involved will be present and will address the ceremony.
EL_062	4	The presidents of Bulgaria, Serbia, North Macedonia, Azerbaijan, the prime minister of Romania and the president of the European Commission.
EL_062	5	The IGB pipeline, along with the other energy infrastructure projects underway and the interconnectors with North Macedonia and Italy, make Greece a critical link and energy entry point to Europe, contributing decisively to energy security and the diversification of energy sources, as has been highlighted by the Greek government.
EL_062	6	Mitsotakis, who will be accompanied by Environment and Energy Minister Kostas Skreka, will have a series of bilateral meetings before and after the ceremony with the Presidents of Bulgaria, Rumen Radev and Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, the Prime Minister of Romania, Nicolae Tsiuka and the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev.
EL_062	7	These bilateral meetings are expected to discuss international and regional developments.
EL_062	8	In particular, the agenda of the meeting with the President of Azerbaijan is expected to include the prospects for further development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, with emphasis on the energy sector, as Azerbaijan is one of the most important suppliers of natural gas in Europe.
EL_062	9	The Prime Minister will also meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and, according to government sources, Mr.
EL_062	10	Mitsotakis is expected to reiterate the urgent need for decisive European action and the imposition of a cap on natural gas.
EL_062	11	He will also insist on this proposal at the informal European Council meeting in Prague next Friday 7 October.
EL_062	12	He will also inform the President of the European Commission about the escalation of Turkish aggressive rhetoric and will reiterate that Greece is in favour of dialogue, based on international law, but will defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

EL_062	14	The reception of the guests is scheduled for 10.30 and the ceremony will begin at 11.00.
EL_069	1	"""One third of pesticides in the EU without risk assessment"
EL_069	2	""""
EL_069	3	Almost a third of pesticides used in EU member states have a licence that has been renewed without a risk assessment, claims consumer organisation Foodwatch.
EL_069	4	Pesticide permits usually have to be renewed every 10 years.
EL_069	5	A prerequisite for a new authorisation is a comprehensive risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
EL_069	6	However, it doesn't always work like that, says Foodwatch.
EL_069	7	"""If the authority fails to carry out risk assessments in a timely manner, existing licences will be extended without reconsideration - in extreme cases up to eight times."
EL_069	8	According to the consumer organisation, 135 of the 455 pesticides authorised in the EU are without a risk assessment.
EL_069	9	This was the result of an evaluation of the EU's pesticide database, the consumer organisation said.
EL_069	10	A typical example is glyphosate.
EL_069	11	The European Commission recently announced that it will extend its use until December 2023.
EL_069	12	This is despite the fact that the final report from the food safety authority is not expected until next year.
EL_069	13	There are also pesticides in use whose authorisation expired in 2013 - and which have not undergone a full risk assessment by EFSA since then.
EL_069	14	"""The approval of every third pesticide in the EU has long since expired, but spraying with them continues on a large scale,"" says Lars Nomaster , spokesman for Foodwatch."
EL_069	15	"""The EU pesticide authorisation system has so many weaknesses that it urgently needs reform,"" says the Foodwatch expert."
EL_069	16	Environmental risks.
EL_069	17	"""The environmental risks of pesticide cocktails are underestimated"", warns the German Environment Agency."
EL_069	18	The Heinrich Böll Foundation reports more than one million cases of pesticide poisoning in southern Europe every year.
EL_069	19	However, pesticide use in the EU has not decreased over the last decades.
EL_069	20	"A European Commission spokesman said however that ""the EU has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world""."
EL_069	21	Similarly, 135 of the 455 pesticides authorised in the EU are affected.
EL_069	22	This was the result of an evaluation of the EU's pesticide database, the consumer organisation said.
EL_069	23	There are also questions about other substances, such as the herbicide flufenacet.
EL_069	24	Among other things, it pollutes groundwater.
EL_069	25	Its approval expired in 2012 - but it is still in use.
EL_069	26	According to Foodwatch, more than 830,000 kilos of this pesticide are used in Germany alone.
EL_069	27	Those pesticides that have been approved without a new risk assessment, Foodwatch is calling for them to be withdrawn from the market immediately.
EL_069	28	The agency also supports higher fees for pesticide manufacturers.
EL_069	29	EU authorities should therefore have sufficient financial resources at their disposal to be able to carry out risk assessments in a timely manner.
EL_069	30	Reactions from producers.
EL_069	31	"Foodwatch is sounding a ""misleading alarm"", says Martin May, CEO of the IVA."
EL_069	32	"""These are substances that have already gone through the rigorous procedure laid down in EU plant protection legislation."
EL_069	33	"Foodwatch's proposals to speed up the process are inappropriate,"" May argues."
EL_071	1	Increasing pressure on Olaf Scholz to approve the shipment of Leopards to Ukraine
EL_071	2	There is increasing pressure from European partners on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is asked to approve the provision of tanks to Ukraine.
EL_071	3	The issue is one of the most pressing that the new German Defence Minister has to deal with Any shipment of German-made military equipment must first be approved by Berlin.
EL_071	4	Pistorius has stated since May that Ukraine has the right to retake its territories, which Russia had put under its control, while other members of the party have been more cautious in their statements.
EL_071	5	Officials from Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Lithuania and Britain asked the German Chancellor yesterday (Tuesday) to immediately approve the shipment of these German-made heavy tanks to Kiev.
EL_071	6	"We hope and try to organise more significant support for Ukraine,"" said Polish President Andrei Duda from Davos. ""We hope that the manufacturer of these tanks, Germany, will participate,"" he added, recalling that Warsaw has proposed to offer 14 Leopards to Kiev."
EL_071	7	Supports Lithuania and Finland in sending equipment
EL_071	8	During the same debate on European defence, Lithuanian President Gitan Naousenda compared the war to a game of chess and noted that Germany must now make its move.
EL_071	9	"""I like to play chess."
EL_071	10	You have to move one pawn and the others follow.
EL_071	11	"Someone has to go ahead and take the decision to support Ukraine, because tanks are becoming a key element of this war, especially now,"" he stressed."
EL_071	12	Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto reiterated his country's support for these equipment deliveries.
EL_071	13	We hope that a decision will be taken (on the delivery of Leopard tanks).
EL_071	14	"Finland is ready to play its role,"" he added during an event dedicated to Ukraine on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos."
EL_071	15	Solts himself is expected to deliver a speech in Davos today at 16:45 GMT.
EL_071	16	Criticism of Germany's stance The Russian invasion of Ukraine last February marked a major change in its defence policy with the chancellor announcing a 100 billion euro budget to improve the equipment of the country's military.
EL_071	17	But the country has regularly tested the patience of its allies and has drawn criticism from Ukraine for its cautious stance on providing equipment to Kiev.
EL_071	18	Since the beginning of the war, Ukraine's European allies have sent Ukraine more than 300 modernised Soviet-built tanks, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling for more modern, Western-built tanks.
EL_071	19	The West has long been reluctant to send tanks to Ukraine as it worries that it will anger Moscow.
EL_071	20	But now the US has announced that it will send Bradley tanks to Ukraine, France will send AMX-10 C light tanks and Britain will send Challenger 2 tanks, which are the first Western-made heavy tanks to be sent to Kiev.
EL_071	21	"British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace noted that there is a debate in Germany whether tanks are ""defensive or offensive weapons"", but called on Berlin to at least give permission for Poland and Finland to offer Leoprard to Ukraine."
EL_071	22	Ukraine's Western allies are to meet on Friday at the US military base in Ramstein, Germany, to coordinate aid to Ukraine.
EL_072	1	"Roberta Metsola's ""Bacchanalian"" symposium in Burgundy revealed by Politico"
EL_072	2	"A new round of discussions is triggered by Politico's revelation about the trip of the President of the European Parliament to Burgundy, which she ""forgot"" to declare in time."
EL_072	3	"At the ""Bacchanalian"" banquet, Metsola was named Dame of the Tastevin fraternity, which is one of the strongest lobbies in the world with at least 12,000 members for the protection and promotion of Burgundy wines."
EL_072	4	"""He was invited as a wine lover and president of the European Parliament,"" say the fraternity's winemakers."
EL_072	5	"In total, the Belgian Le Soir revealed five trips that were ""forgotten"" and declared late, in breach of the code of transparency and conduct applicable to Members of the European Parliament."
EL_072	6	This trip, according to Politico, took place on 22 October 2022 and was declared in the register of the European Parliament on 11 January.
EL_072	7	In Burgundy, Metsola stayed for free with her husband in a suite at the five-star Hôtel Le Cep , at €349 a night, and attended a five-course dinner at the medieval Château Clos de Vougeot , with the menu including fine wine.
EL_072	8	All amounts were paid in full by the hosts.
EL_072	9	The office of the President of the European Parliament insists that she is not subject to the provisions for MEPs concerning gifts and travel declarations.
EL_072	10	"It also clarifies that no third party paid the travel expenses for security reasons. ""Her car trip was paid for and arranged by the European Parliament for security reasons, as is the case every time the president travels,"" an EU official said."
EL_072	11	"European Parliament spokesman Jome Du Guillot told Politico: ""Although these things have never been previously stated by the presidents of the Parliament, President Metsola chose to do so in an unprecedented move to strengthen transparency and set a good example."""
EL_072	12	The wine lobby has influence in France and Brussels The lobby's choice of France and Brussels is considered strong, since wine is a highly exported product that is at the centre of the European Union's trade policy.
EL_072	13	Every year, Europe spends many millions to promote sales of European wines, to protect them from intellectual property theft under its geographical indications system and to subsidise wine growers through the Common Agricultural Policy.
EL_072	14	"An EU official defended Metsola's decision to attend the fraternity's event, which according to its official history was about ""joining as a private citizen""."
EL_072	15	"As she says, the trip is about European gastronomy, which she is proud to promote, while the Dame's title provides for zero activity. ""Her intention was simply to show everyone that we can be open to everything,"" she noted."
EL_072	16	"The Tastevin fraternity was founded in 1934, with the mission of protecting the reputation of Burgundy wine and reviving the ""old Bacchic fraternities"" from the 17th and 18th centuries."
EL_072	17	"The other four trips Metsola had ""forgotten"" to declare The other four trips Metsola had forgotten to declare concern an overnight stay in a hotel in Copenhagen where she travelled to deliver the keynote speech at a conference on democracy paid for by the Alliance of Democracies Foundation."
EL_072	18	Two other overnight stays were made in a hotel in Jerusalem during a state visit paid for by the Israeli government.
EL_072	19	Another overnight stay took place in a hotel in Davos, Switzerland, in order to attend a meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dimitro Kuleba.
EL_072	20	The overnight stay was paid for by a charity called the Victor Pinchuk Foundation.
EL_072	21	Metsola also said that she attended the UEFA Champions League final in Paris last May as a guest of honour.
EL_072	22	Its president on 15 January updated her declaration of financial interests to state for the first time that she was an unpaid trustee on the board of the EU-funded think tank Friends of Europe.
EL_072	23	According to a spokesperson for the think tank, one day later, on 16 January, Metsola resigned from this role, which she had assumed in June 2020.
EL_072	24	He became President of Parliament in January 2022.
EL_072	25	Metsola remained as an unpaid member of the executive board of the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies, the official think tank of her centre-right European People's Party.
EL_072	26	She declared her involvement with the think tank on the Parliament's website on 12 January.
EL_072	27	After the Qatargate corruption scandal, attention is now turning to the travel of other MPs.
EL_072	28	Over 200 individual trips where accommodation, travel or both were paid for by a third party have been reported by MEPs since the start of the current legislative session in 2019, according to an analysis of data available to Politico.
EL_075	1	Research-Analysis: The perfect storm of the climate crisis
EL_075	2	According to the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2023), within a 2-year horizon, 5 of the 10 most serious problems facing humanity will be related to climate change: natural disasters and extreme weather events, natural resource crisis, failure to adapt to climate change plans and failure to mitigate climate change.
EL_075	3	In the next 10 years, a 6th risk, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, will be added to the list.
EL_075	4	"Clearly we are in the ""perfect storm"" of the climate crisis!"
EL_075	5	Europe is getting dangerously old.
EL_075	6	Japan and Italy are among the top countries with a high proportion of people aged 65 and over (36% and 23.7% respectively).
EL_075	7	Finland (22.9%), Portugal (22.6%) follow.
EL_075	8	Greece, unfortunately, is the (essentially) 4-5th worst country in the world, with a rate of 22.5%.
EL_075	9	Europe has the world's worst proportion of people under 15 (16%) and over 65 (19%).
EL_075	10	With the global ratio at 25% and 10% respectively and Africa at 40% and 3%, the demographic prospects of the Old Continent are predicted to be dire.
EL_075	11	Rich countries are more polluting.
EL_075	12	Obviously, per capita emissions in richer countries are much higher than in poorer populations.
EL_075	13	The United States of America and Canada emit the most pollutants per capita (17-18 tonnes per year), while India and Pakistan emit the least (2-2.5 tonnes per year).
EL_075	14	Large-scale and low-cost energy alternatives are lacking to achieve sufficient energy with zero pollutants, while overcoming energy poverty.
EL_075	15	Half the wealth in 81 crooks.
EL_075	16	According to an Oxfam study, the richest 1% of the world's richest people own 63% of the new wealth ($42 trillion) generated in 2020.
EL_075	17	Of this, only $14 trillion reached the remaining 99% of people.
EL_075	18	It is estimated that 1.7 trillion dollars a year is enough to lift 2 billion people out of poverty.
EL_075	19	The richest 1% own 45.6% of the world's wealth, while the poorest half of the world owns just 0.75%; 81 billionaires own more wealth than 50% of the world.
EL_075	20	Over 34 billion tonnes of CO2 every year.
EL_075	21	Since the Industrial Revolution, the world has emitted more than 34 billion tonnes of CO2 every year.
EL_075	22	From year to year, the decreases occur in times of crisis, with the biggest drop occurring during the lockdowns (-2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide), after which emissions soared.
EL_075	23	Emissions from developed economies are in structural decline with a target of climate-neutral 2050.
EL_075	24	Electricity after 2050.
EL_075	25	The three technologies for stable electricity supply are coal-fired, gas-fired and nuclear power.
EL_075	26	Carbon without emissions capture, in the zero emissions scenario, disappears from the global grid by 2050.
EL_075	27	Gas and coal with carbon capture and storage will be key components of global electricity generation from the 2030s onwards.
EL_075	28	The same is expected for hydrogen.
EL_076	1	MoF: Upward revision of growth rate to 2.3% in 2023
EL_076	2	the Ministry of Finance has revised upwards the growth rate this year, to 2.3% from 1.8% in the budget forecast.
EL_076	3	According to ministry officials , the rapid deceleration of gas prices significantly reduces the amount of subsidies for energy, thus increasing the dynamics of the economy, which, in absolute terms, is estimated that this year may be higher by 2- 3 billion euros.
EL_076	4	Indeed, these officials say that if it were not for the banking crisis, the GDP growth estimate would be higher than 2.3%.
EL_076	5	"""This uncertainty makes us conservative in our forecasts,"" they point out."
EL_076	6	This is because the turmoil in the banking sector is prompting financial institutions to limit their risk-taking, at least until stability returns, in order to protect their balance sheets.
EL_076	7	As a result, credit conditions for the real economy will become more difficult, even if only temporarily, not only in Greece but on both sides of the Atlantic.
EL_076	8	For the current year, compared to previous estimates, the projections for primary results are also positive.
EL_076	9	"The forecast of achieving a primary surplus of 0.7% of GDP is back on a ""good footing"" from 2022."
EL_076	10	As the primary budget deficit last year, due to the nominal GDP growth (boosted by the inflation spree), is narrowed towards the level of 1% of GDP (perhaps even lower) against the initial estimate of 1.6% of GDP.
EL_076	11	"However, the finance ministry officials do not hide the fact that the hard times may come from 2024, with the changes in the Stability Pact, which, combined with the ""cutter"" in primary spending, minimizes the scope for flexible fiscal policy."
EL_076	12	As the priority will be to put the budget back on track for permanent primary surpluses.
EL_076	13	"A Finance Ministry official said that discussions with the institutions on achieving primary surpluses below 2% of GDP (which will not be a ""loop"" in the real economy) will start in the autumn by the government that will emerge from the elections."
EL_076	14	This will be preceded by the submission to the European Commission of the Stability Programme (on 30 April) and the Medium Term Programme 2024-2027.
EL_076	15	Both will include the latest assessments of the economy's performance and the budgetary implications of the policies already announced and enacted.
EL_076	16	"It is noted that the economic staff does not ignore the fact that the big ""thorn"" in the economy remains inflation, especially in food and foodstuffs in general."
EL_076	17	"The recent statements by Finance Minister Christos Staikouras that inflation seems to be persistent and he described it as the ""big problem for 2023"" are now typical."
EL_076	18	"He added that it will be a little lower than estimates, around 4.5%, but pointed out that ""we will not see a reduction in prices, nor stabilization, what we will see is prices rising at a reduced rate."""
EL_076	19	And he added that the focus is moving away from energy and focusing on food.
EL_078	1	Christos Staikouras to The Economist: Greece can and will make it
EL_078	2	"This, according to the Minister, is based on the performance of the economy, which ""builds"" confidence, creates ""mounds"", cultivates reasonable expectations and creates positive prospects against the shocks of unpredictable external developments."
EL_078	3	"Staikouras conveyed the updated figures, according to which GDP will be around €210 billion this year and €220 billion in 2023, growing by 5.3% this year and just over 2% next year, combined, he said, with policies ""that ensure fiscal stability""."
EL_078	4	The growth figures of the Greek economy.
EL_078	5	"In his speech, the Finance Minister described the five facts about the economy as follows: ""GDP is growing strongly."
EL_078	6	At the heart of the energy crisis, the economy is growing rapidly, almost twice the European average.
EL_078	7	"The estimate is revised upwards to 5.3% for 2022 (from an initial estimate of 3.1%); ""Over the same period, the European average is estimated at 3.1%."
EL_078	8	"On current data, the country's GDP is expected to reach around €210 billion in 2022 and €220 billion in 2023. ""Growth is also based on impressive growth in investment and exports."
EL_078	9	"This year, following last year's record-breaking year, it is estimated that there will be a new historic performance in foreign direct investment and exports of goods and services. ""In particular: Foreign direct investment reached €5 billion in 2021, recording the highest performance in twenty years."
EL_078	10	"The upward trend continues in 2022, since in the first half of the year they have exceeded 90% of the previous year. ""Exports stood at 41% of GDP in 2021, double the pre-crisis levels."
EL_078	11	"Today, Greece exports more than France, Italy and Spain, and has dramatically increased its exports of high-tech goods. ""Unemployment is shrinking."
EL_078	12	"Having declined by around 6 points, compared to 2019, it is at its lowest level in 12 years, with a significant decrease in the unemployment level of young people and women. ""There has been tremendous progress in the banking sector, with a reduction in non-performing loans and an increase in deposits. ""At the fiscal level, the Commission notes that Greece has achieved the most significant fiscal adjustment."
EL_078	13	"There has been a record reduction in public debt, by 50 points in three years."""
EL_078	14	Christos Staikouras referred to the unstable European environment (e.g. high energy prices, pressure on households) and stressed that it is of utmost importance to continue a consistent fiscal policy for the next four years.
EL_078	15	He said that public debt, while sustainable and on a declining trend, remains high, while private debt of households and businesses is a major problem.
EL_078	16	He reiterated the seven priorities set by the country, such as the strengthening of liquidity in the real economy, the continuation of structural changes (primary health care, etc.), the strengthening of the banking sector through the disinvestment of the state, the maintenance of the effort to reduce energy consumption and the incentives for the new economic structure.

EL_085	2	The majority of Greek workers in the private sector appear dissatisfied in terms of salary, working hours, prospects and other quality issues in their work, according to a survey by INE-GSEE.
EL_085	3	The conclusions are also disappointing on other crucial issues such as the possibility of free expression of opinion within the workplace, the provision by the company of continuous education and training, and the existence of special care in the workplace for the weaker workers.
EL_085	4	"The above conclusions are drawn from a national-scale survey conducted by INE-GSEE, in cooperation with Alco, on the topic ""The quality of work: Presentation of indicators and sample findings"", presented today, Wednesday, at the Kalamata Labour Centre."
EL_085	5	The survey was conducted among a sample of 1,000 people over 17 years old across the country from 1 to 8 March 2019 and participants were asked to answer questions about the factors that make up quality at work.
EL_085	6	Greek workers are disappointed.
EL_085	7	According to the survey, the majority of private sector workers in Greece are dissatisfied with their current employment, particularly with regard to the following parameters: (a) ability to meet their financial obligations based on their earnings; (b) prospect of improving their earnings; (c) intensity and time of work; (d) maintaining a balance between work and leisure time; (e) distribution of assigned responsibilities; and (f) mismatch of their job scope with their studies and qualifications.
EL_085	8	The same survey also highlighted the most important elements that make up the quality of the work environment, such as the possibility of free expression of opinion within the workplace and consultation with management, the provision by the company of continuous education-training to improve the skills of employees, the operation of a health and safety committee within the company and the existence of special care in the workplace for weaker workers.
EL_085	9	"Greece is consistently at the bottom of the OECD's ""Job Insecurity Index"" The presentation also highlighted findings from recent international surveys on the quality of work and the factors that determine it."
EL_085	10	"In particular, according to the OECD, Greece is consistently ranked last out of 33 countries in terms of the indicators ""Work Intensity"" and ""Occupational Insecurity""."
EL_085	11	Similarly, the UN Economic Commission for Europe survey develops a framework for a comprehensive approach to assessing the quality of work in its multiple aspects, consisting of 68 indicators relating to the quality of employment from the perspective of the employed worker (Safety and ethics at work, Income and benefits from work, Working hours and work-life balance, Labour protection and social welfare, Social dialogue, Skills development and training, Social protection and social security, Social protection and social protection, Social protection and social protection, Social dialogue, Skills development and training, Social protection and social security, Social protection and social protection, Social protection and social security, Social protection and social security).
EL_085	12	These findings come in addition to a series of surveys that INE-GSEE has submitted to the public debate in recent times and which overall demonstrate the degradation that has been suffered by work and workers in our country, says the GSEE in its statement.
EL_089	1	Where the bar is set in the three keys of n.
EL_089	2	Katseli The haircut that will be given to loans guaranteed by the first home, the interest rate and the income criteria, which will be set both in the part of non-performing loans subsidized by the state and the rest are, according to Euro2day.gr, the three major issues for the banks.
EL_089	3	This is because they will largely judge the capital needs that will arise for the banking system from the expanded regulation proposed by the government's proposal.
EL_089	4	"As for the ""cheese"" of the state subsidy, reliable information says that the budget exceeds 300 million euros, a fact that was brought to the attention of the bankers at the meeting under the Prime Minister."
EL_089	5	Increased perimeter.
EL_089	6	"The proposal given to the bankers in order to ""run"" all possible scenarios in order to calculate the additional provisions provides, according to reports, that non-performing mortgages and corporate loans guaranteed by first homes with an objective value of up to 200,000 euros, while the remaining amount of the loan should not exceed 120,000-150,000 euros."
EL_089	7	Banking sources tell Euro2day.gr that with this data, more than 200,000 loans will be able to come under the umbrella of protection.
EL_089	8	The thorns.
EL_089	9	The horizon is clearer for non-performing loans that will receive a subsidy, which corresponds to 1/3 of the instalment and will be subsidised by the state with a budget of EUR 300 million.
EL_089	10	This is because, according to information, the government and banks are converging on the view that this protection measure should apply exclusively to financially weak borrowers with a family income in the region of 20,000 euros, perhaps a little higher.
EL_089	11	On the contrary, there is a difference between the two sides on the remaining loans, i.e. those that will be settled without state subsidy of the instalment (with extensions, haircuts, etc.).
EL_089	12	In the proposal sent by the government to the institutions (Commission and ECB) last Thursday for borrowers outside the measure of state subsidies, placed the objective value of the house at the ceiling of 250,000 euros and the annual net family income up to 35,000 euros.
EL_089	13	Euro2day.gr reports that the negotiations on the income of this category continue with the government reportedly open to reducing the initial 35,000 euros below 30,000 euros.
EL_089	14	However, banks are also worried about the interest rate that the loans will carry as the benchmark rate, which is Euribor, is at almost zero levels, so the spread cannot open at very high levels.
EL_089	15	"In any case, the biggest ""thorn"" is the haircut that will be given under the arrangement."
EL_089	16	Banking sources stress that the haircut cannot be horizontal, as the losses that banks will incur will be severe.
EL_089	17	The haircut will be made on the difference between the loan balance and the value of the property, not in its entirety but on a percentage of it, which will vary according to: the borrower's deposits, the amount of income, his/her remaining assets and his/her ability to liquidate them.
EL_093	1	Kinal, DIMAR, Potami - Pieces and shards of the centre-left
EL_093	2	The developments in the centre-left are now unpredictable due to the apparent passage of the Prespes Agreement in the Parliament.
EL_093	3	It is now obvious, both in the environment of Fofi Gennimata, as well as in Potami and DIMAR, that Alexis Tsipras is using the compromise with Skopje as a vehicle for the convergence of SYRIZA with the progressive voters and the reconstruction of the area... of course under his leadership.
EL_093	4	"Whether the project will succeed will be crucial for the electoral survival of SYRIZA, but also for its transformation into a ""normal"" social democratic European party."
EL_093	5	"What the prime minister is seeking is stated by the prime minister himself, in his interview with Avgi tis Kyriaki: ""The agreement will be the catalyst for the convergence of progressive forces""..."
EL_093	6	"Freed from his uncomfortable alliance with the ""national populist"" Panos Kamenos, forgetting what he said until yesterday about the ""irreplaceable"" Panos... the prime minister is building bridges with that part of the centre-left that opposes nationalist rhetoric and rallies, is wary of New Democracy's departure from the Belgrade line and is positive about the agreement with Zaev, even if he has reservations."
EL_093	7	And Alexis Tsipras' persistent flirtation with the area where PASOK once led is causing serious turbulence across the spectrum of the centre-left.
EL_093	8	The first side effects have already appeared.
EL_093	9	The Potami has been trimmed and is heading for dissolution , because of the Agreement.
EL_093	10	Stavros Theodorakis is left with two more loyal MPs, without a Parliamentary Group and without the status of political leader, and is pondering his next moves.
EL_093	11	In any case, in the opinion polls, the party rarely exceeds 1.5% and this reinforces the centrifugal tendencies.
EL_093	12	In Kinal, Fofi Gennimata may come to the vote with a solid Parliamentary Group, but the deletion of Thanasis Theocharopoulos - due to the positive vote on the Agreement - and the crisis in relations between Kinal and DIMAR, shrink, even if only slightly, her already relatively limited electoral audience.
EL_093	13	"Besides, the ""plus"" in the alliance between Kinal and Dimar was not so much the few remaining voters of the Democratic Left, but the image of the new socialist party, free from the arrogance of the past, which coalesced with the forces of the renewal left."
EL_093	14	While of course no one is yet able to predict how George Papandreou will react to the intention of Mrs.
EL_093	15	Gennimata to lead the Movement for Change to an extraordinary Congress, with the abolition of the individual component parties, so that the Movement for Change can have a unified voice.
EL_093	16	The reason for this is the Prespa Agreement, which the former Prime Minister views positively.
EL_093	17	The first information wants Mr Papandreou rather annoyed with the moves of the president of Kinal, judging by what Thanasis Theocharopoulos said yesterday in a TV interview.
EL_093	18	"As for the inside of the DIMAR, its small size is not certain to prevent a new crisis, with some of them insisting for reasons of political survival on joining forces with Kinal, and the rest of the members supporting the ""ideologically pure view"" of Thanasis Theocharopoulos, in favour of the agreement."
EL_093	19	A great unrest, a wonderful situation, as they say in SYRIZA, citing Mao.
EL_093	20	"To the confusion caused within the parties of the centre-left by the Prespes Agreement, we should add the individual ""personalities"" of the area, who do not hide their intention to participate in a new formation, under Alexis Tsipras, which will give an outlet to their personal ambitions."
EL_093	21	"On the occasion of Macedonia, Yannis Ragousis, Louka Katseli, Nikos Bistis and others declare themselves ""willing"" to overcome the divisions of the anti-memorandum struggle, to forget the German cholos and the hangings at Syntagma, in order to gain a role in the new formation that will offer them a new political career."
EL_093	22	"For many of them, the ""anti-memorandum indignation"", expressed through verbal - and not only - violence, is a thing of the past..."
EL_093	23	Evangelos Venizelos, in an article published yesterday in Nea, warned about the hypocrisy, as he claims, of Alexis Tsipras.
EL_093	24	"""He wants to take off the leonine of the anti-memorandum and put on the mantle of the so-called centre-left, while he has stripped public life of all value,"" he said."
EL_093	25	But Alexis Tsipras will insist.
EL_093	26	The next appointment is the reshuffle, which all indications are that it will have a centre-left bias.
EL_093	27	There are many willing...
EL_093	28	In all places.

EL_109	1	The Vaccination Gateway is under-utilised - Huge delay for entry to the €300,000 Gateway
EL_109	2	The Vaccination Portal is facing problems again since, as citizens have complained to us and we have seen for ourselves, the wait for entry to the Portal is very long and does not proceed, unlike the previous days when, despite the long wait, the online queue proceeded quickly.
EL_109	3	300.000 euros with many technical problems.
EL_109	4	Due to the many problems that arise daily with the Vaccination Gateway, the Audit Office will carry out an ex officio audit.
EL_109	5	In particular, it will check whether the contract, which cost more than 300 thousand euros, excluding VAT, was properly executed.
EL_109	6	A specific audit of the information system will also be carried out, as well as looking into complaints that in some cases a particular vaccine was exhausted before the Portal was accessible to the public.
EL_109	7	"Still, due to the many and repeated problems, the ""microscope"" of the Service will be under the ""microscope"" and the possibility of claiming damages from the company that undertook the design of the gate."
EL_109	8	The spokesman of the Audit Service, Marios Petridis, in yesterday's statements pointed out that the system of the gateway is considered objectively simple, while the large and massive connection of citizens should also be foreseen.
EL_109	9	In order to carry out the audit, the Service requested information from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of State for Innovation.
EL_109	10	In terms of scheduling, the Ministry of Health is moving quickly to make appointments available for the 20-29 age group.
EL_109	11	Today and tomorrow the Vaccination Gateway for 27-28 and 25-26 year olds, respectively.
EL_109	12	Today from 7:30 in the morning until 5:30 in the afternoon it will be open for 27-28 and tomorrow for 25-26, at the same hours.
EL_109	13	Compared to yesterday's data and the 29-30 year olds, interest was again high.
EL_109	14	The gate opened at 7:30 and by 9:30, 8,393 appointments had been made, out of the 12,598 available.
EL_109	15	It is noted that yesterday there were no technical problems at the Vaccination Gate, as shortly after 9:30 a problem arose, since several citizens did not have access.
EL_109	16	Finally, shortly after 10:00 am, the gate reopened normally for everyone.
EL_109	17	According to an announcement by the Ministry of Health, 36.5% of the population in Cyprus has already been vaccinated with the first dose.
EL_109	18	By province, in Nicosia the vaccination coverage is 37.1%, in Limassol 34.6%, in Larnaca 35.6%, in Paphos 40.1% and in Famagusta 33.1%.
EL_109	19	The Ministry notes that the benefits of vaccination are now evident, as the number of cases and hospital admissions have decreased significantly.
EL_109	20	It is also noteworthy that cases of cases with a history of vaccination have mild symptoms and do not result in hospitalisation.
EL_111	1	A fire week begins Monday 29 March 2021, 00:01 It's getting late.
EL_111	2	Tomorrow, Tuesday, the Parliament will hold a debate in Parliament on the establishment of a preliminary investigation committee, which will investigate the possible involvement of former minister Nikos Pappas in the Kalogritsa case.
EL_111	3	"It is not excluded that the Pappas case and the Papandreopoulos case on Novartis, will lead to the definitive dismantling of SYRIZA and its tattered ""moral advantage""."
EL_111	4	It was getting late.
EL_111	5	Tomorrow Tuesday in Parliament, the debate on the establishment of a preliminary investigation committee will be held in Parliament, which will investigate the possible involvement of former minister Nikos Pappas in the Kalogritsa case, and the three million that he says he received from the Lebanese CCC, as an advance in order to participate in the tender for television licenses, to create Syrizokanalo.
EL_111	6	It is not excluded that the Pappas case and the Papandreopoulos case on Novartis will lead to the final dismantling of SYRIZA and its tattered moral advantage.
EL_111	7	It is also possible that, at the end of the investigation of the two cases, it will become clear to the remaining wondering well-wishers why the strong anti-Syrian front was formed spontaneously and spontaneously.
EL_111	8	And because it stands strong, without cracks, so that any losses that it is reasonable for the Southwest to face at the peak of its difficulties are not directed towards the territory of Syriza.
EL_111	9	Its leadership is aware of the criticality of the two cases for the future of the party as a party in power, so it is preparing its defence in belligerent tones, using the cliché that the best defence is attack.
EL_111	10	Of course they will take the possible impeachment of Pappas as a pretext, in order for the government to hit Alexis Tsipras.
EL_111	11	They will be right!
EL_111	12	But not for the pretense, but for the responsibility of the leader.
EL_111	13	What Nikos Pappas is accused of doing (if it turns out that he did), what emerges for the moment from the testimonies and the emails exchanged by those involved, show that a very large project of restructuring the entire television landscape was attempted, which would be unthinkable if the leader had no knowledge of it.
EL_111	14	The same applies, of course, to the biggest scandal since the creation of the Greek state, the Novartis case.
EL_111	15	It is one thing for the former Prime Minister not to prove his involvement, and another for him not to have knowledge of the conspiracy that was uncovered in order to accuse the most powerful political figures of the opposition at the time.
EL_111	16	Dimitris Tzanakopoulos, also a lawyer, will carry the burden from the SYRIZA side, assisted by SYRIZA's legal deputies and Pavlos Polakis.
EL_111	17	It is perhaps an explanation why Alexis was promoting the apsy during the election and they were drinking seaside raki in Rethymno in May 2019.
EL_111	18	He needed his style in difficult situations.
EL_111	19	But the problem is that while Polakis has a dedicated audience that worships his outspoken opposition, for exactly the same reasons he has accumulated a huge mass of dislike, not only among their political opponents, but also within the SYRIZA camp.
EL_111	20	Tsipras' intention to rock hard was evident from his warnings on the Piraeus Bank capital increase, where he warned the government that it is staging political prosecutions against its opponent for the Piraeus scandal, but will answer for it to Greek society.
EL_111	21	This is coming from the man who, during his premiership, Greek banks were liquidated, and he passed it with flying colors, because Mitsotakis didn't want to turn the Parliament into an examination industry.
EL_111	22	We will experience a period of political frenzy that we hope will not be accompanied by any kind of extremes, and with the purpose of communicative diversion, as the revelations about the imaginative activities carried out by the members of the former government proceed.
EL_111	23	However, both cases are well advanced, so that any diversions will not succeed in making it difficult to solve them.
EL_111	24	And then perhaps some will experience a defeat, the effects of which will be felt for years to come.
EL_111	25	They brought it on themselves with their inflamed amoralism.
EL_111	26	They thought they would be in power for years and that no one would hold them to account.
EL_113	1	Hatzidakis teleconference with a network of women entrepreneurs -The changes promoted by the new bill
EL_113	2	The government's initiatives for gender equality and the family were presented in a teleconference with the Greek Women Entrepreneurs' Chamber Network (EEDEGE) by the Minister of Labour Kostis Hatzidakis and the Minister of Demographic and Family Policy and Gender Equality Maria Syrengela.
EL_113	3	"""Our ministry should be in practice a ministry of equality and family."
EL_113	4	"And this is clearly demonstrated by the provisions of the draft law on the protection of employment, both on violence and harassment - where we are pioneers at European level - and on the reconciliation of work and family life, where we have gone beyond the provisions of the relevant European directive"", said Mr."
EL_113	5	Hadjidakis.
EL_113	6	During the teleconference, the President of the EEDGE, Mrs.
EL_113	7	Sofia Kounenaki-Efraimoglou presented the Network's proposals for the first two chapters of the bill.
EL_113	8	The teleconference was also attended by the Deputy Minister of State for Labour and Social Affairs, responsible for Demographic Policy and Family, Maria Syringela and the Secretary General for Demographic and Family Policy and Gender Equality, Gianna Chormova.
EL_113	9	Mr.Hatzidakis stressed that the relevant provisions of the bill come in continuation of the package of measures already adopted (granting a birth allowance of 2,000 euros, increasing the tax-free threshold for each child, reducing VAT on baby items, etc.) and show the direction in which the government is moving.
EL_113	10	Measures to tackle violence in the workplace.
EL_113	11	The Minister then outlined the main arrangements:
EL_113	12	"He said, ""With regard to violence and harassment in the workplace, we are not just bringing Convention 190 of the International Labour Office to Parliament for ratification, but we are introducing a substantial package of measures."""
EL_113	13	Specifically:
EL_113	14	Does it broaden the scope of prohibited conduct, but also of protected persons?
EL_113	15	Are employers' obligations reinforced, including by the obligation to draw up policies on violence and sexual harassment?
EL_113	16	Is provision being made for the immediate protection of those affected, including through the introduction of new procedures before the independent Labour Inspectorate?
EL_113	17	"Is the ""Equality Mark"" extended to businesses that show increased sensitivity to issues of violence and harassment?"
EL_113	18	Initiatives to raise public awareness are underway
EL_113	19	Initiatives to reconcile family and professional life.
EL_113	20	On the chapter on reconciling family and professional life , Mr.
EL_113	21	"Hatzidakis stressed that ""we are going beyond the minimum of the Directive's provisions"", as: paid, longer than the Directive's provision of 10 days; Protect new fathers from dismissal for six months after the birth of the child, giving them protection similar to that enjoyed by the mother; Establish parental leave of four months - with subsidies from the OAED for the two months - for both father and mother for each child? Are a number of other arrangements being promoted to make it easier for working parents, such as teleworking, flexible working hours or part-time work? Carer's leave and assisted reproductive leave are introduced."
EL_113	22	"""With these two chapters, the government is showing its sensitivity to issues of gender equality, violence and harassment at work, and support for the family."
EL_113	23	We are talking about modern measures, in line with good European practices.
EL_113	24	"It is the will of the State not only to pass the law -after it comes to the Parliament- but also to implement it, so that we can progress and approach the most advanced countries of the EU in these critical social issues"", Mr."
EL_113	25	Hadjidakis.
EL_113	26	"""We are open to dialogue,"" said Maria Syrengela."
EL_113	27	"Minister of State for Demographic Policy and the Family, Maria Syrengela, said: ""We listened with particular attention to the proposals of the members of the National Network of Greek Women Entrepreneurs."
EL_113	28	"Our goal is to adapt the country's labour legislation to the new developments, to protect women's rights and to encourage female entrepreneurship because it is an engine of growth for the Greek economy."""
EL_113	29	"Mrs Syrengela added that ""we are open to dialogue and we are working with social partners to support women's work and promote measures that contribute to the equal utilisation of human resources""."
EL_113	30	Empowering women in work and entrepreneurship.
EL_113	31	"The Secretary General for Demographic and Family Policy and Gender Equality, Gianna Hormova, stressed that ""in the DGWPSP we aim to empower women in the field of work and entrepreneurship""."
EL_113	32	"As he said, ""this objective is pursued through the developing actions, through the ongoing dialogue with social stakeholders, but also through the promoted changes in legislation."
EL_113	33	"It is now clear that without women there is no development and that is why we are trying to protect them through legislation."""
EL_121	1	Christodoulides' positions on tourism:
EL_121	2	Proposes the creation of a promotion body
EL_121	3	The strengthening of the 2030 tourism strategy, the creation of a promotion body and the promotion of Cypriot gastronomy and Cypriot products are among the positions on tourism presented at the Paralimni Municipal Hall by the independent candidate for the presidency of the Republic, Nikos Christodoulides.
EL_121	4	In a statement by the Staff, it is stated that the proposals were formulated on the basis of discussions with professionals of the industry, the existing strategy of the Ministry of State and reflect the issues that have been discussed and discussed over time among tourism stakeholders, taking into account international trends and how the tourism industry will contribute to the prosperity and quality of life of all residents of Cyprus.
EL_121	5	Our priority, Christodoulides said, is to support the private initiative, so that we walk together with responsibility for the future of Cyprus tourism.
EL_121	6	In this direction, we are updating and strengthening the Tourism Strategy 2030 for the sustainable development of the tourism industry, taking into account the international data that are constantly changing and directly affect us.
EL_121	7	In his speech, Nikos Christodoulides referred to the creation of a Promotion Agency, aiming to upgrade the promotion activities of Cyprus as a tourist destination, which will operate in close cooperation with the private sector and tourism operators, and to strengthen the air connectivity of Cyprus by establishing strategic partnerships with airlines and neighbouring countries.
EL_121	8	The aim is to extend connectivity to distant destinations from which we can attract higher quality tourism, he said.
EL_121	9	Emphasis is also placed on increasing the number of airlines that use our country's airports as a base, with the aim of flexibility and penetration in new and existing markets.
EL_121	10	The adaptation of the tourism sector to technological developments, he continued, is a key priority and there should be synergies with the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy.
EL_121	11	We support this adaptation by enhancing the digital transformation of tourism in Cyprus in all sectors in order to upgrade the digital presence of our destination locally and globally.
EL_121	12	In order to achieve these goals, Christodoulides said, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the utilization and strengthening of bilateral political relations and the establishment of political trust, which will contribute decisively to the promotion of economic, trade and tourism relations.
EL_121	13	In the same context, we are investing in economic diplomacy to establish relations with other countries and with global tourism giants in order to strengthen existing markets and develop new ones, he added.
EL_121	14	According to Mr Christodoulides, the aim is to promote educational seminars through the Human Resources Development Authority in cooperation with the competent Deputy Ministry and all stakeholders, while emphasis is placed on the enrichment of our tourism product.
EL_121	15	We strengthen and promote, among others, sports, medical, diving, business, and cultural/religious tourism, aiming at extending the tourist season, mitigating the problem of seasonality.
EL_121	16	He also said that we highlight the gastronomy of Cyprus at an international level and through local actions, giving the traditional flavours of our country the value they deserve, by implementing actions to promote Cypriot cuisine and Cypriot products.
EL_121	17	Christodoulides also referred to the creation of a tourism observatory in line with international standards, aiming at the continuous recording and analysis of data concerning the whole range of tourism activities both in Cyprus and in competitive destinations.
EL_126	1	Heating allowance: until 21 December the payment of the first instalment
EL_126	2	What the EIA provides.
EL_126	3	Mr. Vessiropoulos referred to the new data formed by the Joint Ministerial Decision A1156/2022, on the amount, beneficiaries, conditions and the procedure for granting the heating allowance for this year's winter period.
EL_126	4	With this ministerial decision, as specifically mentioned: - extended the granting of heating allowance for heating oil, in addition to the subsidy of heating fuel oil, natural gas, LPG, LPG, fuel oil, biomass pellet and thermal energy through district heating, which was in force last year. - the income criteria and the limits on the total value of the property were broadened to include more beneficiaries in the subsidy and the calculation basis and the maximum limit of the subsidy were increased. - a doubling of the amount of the allowance was foreseen, which can reach EUR 1 600 for new beneficiaries who do not use gas and for old beneficiaries who stop using gas and replace it with one of the other subsidised fuels or with district heating.
EL_126	5	The allowance will be paid in three instalments. - In order to ensure liquidity to consumers, when the first instalment is granted, which will be paid by 21 December 2022, old beneficiaries will be able to receive as an advance payment the total amount of the heating allowance paid to them during the previous winter period.
EL_126	6	The advance payment will be offset against subsequent payments of the allowance.
EL_126	7	In relation to the granting of heating allowance to consumers of firewood and biomass, ie pellets, the Deputy Minister of Finance said that the granting of this allowance is linked to the condition that the property is located in a settlement with a population equal to or less than ten thousand inhabitants and the corresponding subsidy rate, which was determined on the basis of climatic conditions, to be equal to or greater than 0.8.
EL_126	8	As Mr. Vessiropoulos pointed out, the Ministry of Environment and Energy has taken measures to facilitate logging operations to local populations and to make available free of charge or for a symbolic price, firewood from forestry cooperatives to residents throughout Greece.
EL_126	9	This year the Ministry of Environment and Energy allocated 4.5 million euros, the highest amount in the last decade, to the Forest Policy Implementation Inspection Services of Macedonia-Thrace, Epirus, Western Macedonia, Thessaly, Sterea Ellada, Peloponnese, Western Greece and Ionian Islands to cover the individual needs of residents in mountainous areas of the country.
EL_126	10	MPA25: Inadequate measures.
EL_126	11	The MP of MP 25, Kriton Arsenis, described the measures as insufficient.
EL_126	12	"""We are talking about a country where two salaries now go to the electricity bills."
EL_126	13	In Florina, in Kastoria, in the mountains of Ioannina, in the mountains of Drama and other areas, in Grevena, we have another four salaries going to heating.
EL_126	14	"It's not something that fits into a small increase - which you described - in heating allowances,"" he said."
EL_126	15	"Arsenis and added: ""A family with two children and an apartment of one hundred square metres needs two and a half thousand litres of oil."
EL_126	16	The net cost is 645 euros and 1,855 euros in taxes.
EL_126	17	You give them 722 euros.
EL_126	18	That's a funny amount!
EL_126	19	It makes no real difference.
EL_126	20	Obviously it's better than the best, but it doesn't save them.
EL_126	21	We are talking about areas where they have reached the point of burning lignite in their homes.
EL_126	22	They take lignite and burn it either in stoves or in various wood burners, with terrible health effects.
EL_126	23	"The pollutants that cause shortness of breath, asthma and more in these areas are not just off limits, but several times the limit."""
EL_126	24	"""Just as we have a transport equivalent, we should have an energy equivalent for the areas that have the greatest need for heating."
EL_126	25	"We need to find the energy equivalent"", said the MEP of MP25 and called for more support for energy saving and energy cost reduction projects."
EL_126	26	"""They are not asking you not to be charged for oil, which they should be asking you."
EL_126	27	They are asking you not to charge the tax above the 500 litres which is average.
EL_126	28	They are asking you to give them a break on the tax over five hundred litres of heating.
EL_126	29	And not in a way that will lead to smuggling, simply by returning to their taxisnet, individually, in a clean way, in a way that is not protective against any possible exploitation.
EL_126	30	"The money should go cleanly to the people who need it"", said the MP of MP 25."
EL_130	1	Why Erdogan seeks a lifeline from Putin
EL_130	2	Turkey is facing a difficult crossroads and is finding it difficult to keep up with the rapid pace of developments and developments on the Syrian crisis front.
EL_130	3	Tomorrow's meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow is of crucial importance for the development of the Syrian issue.
EL_130	4	Tayyip Erdogan has for days seen US President Donald Trump rethinking his promise to withdraw US troops from Syria and not giving a clear timetable for withdrawal.
EL_130	5	Time is money for Ankara, which sees the Kurdish fighters supported operationally by Washington and dreams of an autonomous state on Turkey's southern border.
EL_130	6	This is why Tayyip Erdogan is promoting the creation of a security zone in northern Syria from which he can control the situation and attack the Kurdish fighters of the People's Protection Units (YPG).
EL_130	7	For his part, Vladimir Putin, who is the great victor of the Syrian war and who is determining developments, wants the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad to take control of northern Syria and gradually of the whole country after the withdrawal of US troops.
EL_130	8	At the same time, the Kurds are negotiating through Moscow with Damascus in order to reach an agreement with the Syrian government, because they know that once the American soldiers leave, they will be attacked by Turkey.
EL_130	9	The same role, that of mediator, is what Turkey wants from Moscow.
EL_130	10	In particular, Ankara would like to see Russia influencing the Syrian president in order to allow Ankara to take control of certain Kurdish areas in northern Syria.
EL_130	11	In return, Ankara could offer to negotiate a withdrawal from the city of Idlib where Russian and Syrian troops wish to launch an attack against terrorist groups linked to al-Qaeda.
EL_130	12	However, discontent is strong in the political corridors of Ankara over the course of the Syrian crisis and the Turkish role in the Middle East.
EL_130	13	The main thrust of Turkey's foreign policy was that it wanted to play a leading role in developments in the Middle East.
EL_130	14	This axis, however, seems to be shaken by the position it has taken on the Syrian issue.
EL_130	15	Initially, Tayyip Erdogan isolated and attacked Bashar al-Assad, as he believed he was about to lose the presidency because of the violent protests.
EL_130	16	This formula did not work and today he is obliged to negotiate with him.
EL_130	17	Moreover, the other Arab states are ready to welcome the Syrian president back into their ranks with honour.
EL_130	18	Such a development could mean the formation of an anti-Turkish front by the Arab states, a development that is of particular concern to the Turkish president, who is turning to Vladimir Putin for a lifeline.
EL_134	1	"""Rebuilding Europe with new taxes"""
EL_134	2	A joint letter by former Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou, Portuguese former Regional Development Minister Miguel Manturo and Spanish professor at the School of Transnational Governance Carlos Cloza is published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on the occasion of the EU summit on 23 April on supporting the economy affected by the measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
EL_134	3	"The letter is entitled ""Rebuilding Europe with new taxes""."
EL_134	4	"The three authors suggest: ""European heads of state and government should seek centralised financial support for each country in need."
EL_134	5	"It is crucial that it is partly about financing or transfers of EU funds to states and not about credits."""
EL_134	6	"For the origin of the funds the authors of the letter suggest: ""The first source is the taxation of the digital economy, one of the few sectors of the economy benefiting from the crisis."
EL_134	7	The second source is a CO2 tax.
EL_134	8	Given the decline in oil prices, this tax would ensure that the prices involved would not distort economic decisions in favour of maintaining coal-based production systems.
EL_134	9	This would also be in line with the will to keep the Green Deal as a central element for the recovery of the economy.
EL_134	10	The same resources could then be used to cover the EU's debts created by the financing of the Reconstruction Fund.
EL_134	11	"The Fund should be designed to protect and strengthen the rule of law in the Member States."""
EL_134	12	"And the letter concludes: ""This proposal is both ambitious and feasible because it combines different aspects."
EL_134	13	It does not involve tax transfers between Member States and limits the impact of the crisis on indebted countries.
EL_134	14	At the same time, its implementation contributes to solidarity between EU Member States and fairness in the internal market.
EL_134	15	Moreover, with a more stable EU budget, the Reconstruction Fund can be financed without increasing national financial contributions.
EL_134	16	"And this proposal achieves all this by promoting the three key points of the European Covid-19 agenda: regulating the digital economy, strengthening the Green Deal and protecting the rule of law."""
EL_134	17	Praise for the treatment of coronavirus but difficult in the summer.
EL_134	18	The Süddeutsche Zeitung publishes an article on the coronavirus pandemic in Greece and the negative impact it will have on tourism.
EL_134	19	"However, the newspaper notes that ""compared to other countries, the country has done well in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic... But even if Greece has managed to prevent a giant wave of deaths, a terrible economic shock as a result of the pandemic threatens the country."
EL_134	20	The Achilles' heel of the Greek economy is tourism.
EL_134	21	"It accounts for half of economic growth in 2018, one in four jobs in the country depends on tourism, in some islands the tourism sector contributes 90% of GDP."""
EL_134	22	"And the newspaper continues: ""On the back of the country's successes in dealing with the pandemic, many are holding out hope that the 2020 tourist season will not be completely lost, but with a delay in July or August it may still go ahead."
EL_134	23	But this depends, as Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told the newspaper Kathimerini at the weekend, not only on what happens in Greece, but also on what happens in Great Britain, France, Germany, those countries where many tourists come every year.
EL_134	24	Greece again has more of its own reserves than in previous years, and it also enjoys greater confidence in Europe.
EL_134	25	So the ECB recently decided to buy 12 billion euros worth of Greek bonds.
EL_134	26	The recession is inevitable, Mitsotakis admitted, but growth in 2021 will be higher than the recession of 2020.
EL_134	27	Maria Rigoutsou.
EL_141	1	Fire Department: The picture of the major fire fronts -106 forest fires in the last 24 hours
EL_141	2	The number of forest fires throughout Greece, in which the Fire Brigade had to intervene in the last 24 hours, has reached 106, according to an update from the Fire Service.
EL_141	3	At the same time, it gives an overview of the major fire fronts that are currently in progress.
EL_141	4	Specifically, from 19:00 on 11 August until the same time today, 106 forest fires occurred.
EL_141	5	The fire-fighting operations are also assisted by forces made available through the European Civil Protection Mechanism, as well as through bilateral contracts.
EL_141	6	The Armed Forces, volunteer firefighters, water trucks and OTA project machinery are also providing assistance.
EL_141	7	In detail: In the forest fire of Parnitha, strong ground forces continue to operate.
EL_141	8	Assistance is provided by the Greek Army with infantry units, volunteer firefighters, as well as water trucks and O.T.A. project machinery.
EL_141	9	In the forest fire of North Evia, strong ground forces that have been reinforced through the European Civil Protection Mechanism continue to operate, namely, from Ukraine 100 firefighters, from Serbia 39 firefighters with 14 vehicles and an ambulance, from Romania 108 firefighters with 21 vehicles, from Slovakia 75 firefighters with 30 vehicles, from Poland 143 firefighters with 46 vehicles, from Moldova 25 firefighters with 4 vehicles and the Mobile Operational Centre OLYMPOS.
EL_141	10	Also, for aerial firefighting, 9 E/As including 2 E/As from Serbia and 1 E/A from the Arab Emirates as well as 8 A/Fs including 2 AA/Fs from Israel, 2 Ilyushin Il-76 from Russia and the Beriev-200 operate periodically.
EL_141	11	Assistance is provided by the Coast Guard, the Armed Forces with foot patrols, volunteer firefighters and the local government with water trucks and project machinery.
EL_141	12	In the forest fires of Ancient Olympia Ilia and Gortynia Arcadia , continue to operate strong ground forces that have been reinforced through the European Civil Protection Mechanism and specifically from the Czech Republic 35 firefighters with 14 vehicles, from France 240 firefighters with 60 vehicles, from Germany 244 firefighters with 56 vehicles and from Austria 40 firefighters with 13 vehicles, while the Mobile Operational Center OLYMPOS is in the area of the fire.
EL_141	13	Also, for aerial firefighting, there are periodically operating 6 aircraft as well as 9 aircraft including 1 aircraft of the Hellenic Army Air Force and 2 aircraft from Switzerland.
EL_141	14	Assistance is provided by volunteer firefighters, water trucks and OTA project machinery.
EL_141	15	The firefighting forces are coordinated by the Chief of the Fire Brigade, Lieutenant General Stefanos Kolokouris.
EL_141	16	All Fire Brigade services in the Territory remain on general alert.
EL_141	17	Most fires were dealt with immediately, at their initial stage.
EL_141	18	The local investigative offices, as well as teams of the Directorate for the Fight against Arson Crimes (DAEE) are investigating the causes of the fires.
EL_142	1	Attack in Istanbul: Turkey seeks suspect in Bulgaria through Interpol -
EL_142	2	Greece was also informed
EL_142	3	Interpol has issued an alert to Turkey's neighbouring countries regarding a suspect in the deadly blast in Istanbul.
EL_142	4	According to the Interpol alert, a person allegedly involved in the explosion that led to the bloodbath in Istanbul is in Bulgaria and has issued an alert to neighbouring countries, including Greece, to arrest him if he crosses the border.
EL_142	5	Authorities have launched a manhunt to identify the perpetrators of the bloody attack that claimed the lives of six people and injured 81 more civilians.
EL_142	6	In the hands of the authorities a woman.
EL_142	7	The name of the woman who allegedly bloodied Istanbul's Istiklal pedestrian street has been released by the Turkish authorities.
EL_142	8	She is Ahlam Albashir, originally from Syria, with the authorities releasing a photo of the suspect after her arrest.
EL_142	9	According to the Istanbul police, the alleged perpetrator of the blast is of Syrian origin and admitted during the interrogation that she was trained by Kurdish rebels and that she entered Turkey from the Syrian province of Afrin.
EL_142	10	"The woman is accused of acting at the behest of ""a PKK terrorist group based in Kobani, Syria""."
EL_142	11	Kurds or ISIS behind the attack? Turkey blamed Kurdish rebels for the blast that killed six people on a busy Istanbul shopping street and police arrested a Syrian woman on suspicion of planting the bomb, while also arresting 46 other people.
EL_142	12	Interior Minister Suleiman Soylu said the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia were responsible for the blast.
EL_142	13	Ankara claims that the YPG is a wing of the PKK.
EL_142	14	The US has supported the YPG in the conflict in Syria, resulting in friction with Turkey, a NATO ally.
EL_142	15	Albashir is shown in handcuffs in a video by the state television network TRT Haber.
EL_142	16	"She has curly hair and wears a red jumpsuit with the words ""New York"" written on it."
EL_142	17	The PKK denies any involvement.
EL_142	18	"""We have nothing to do with this incident and it is known to the public that we would not directly target civilians, nor would we approve of actions targeting civilians,"" the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) said in a statement on the powerful explosion in Istanbul that killed six people."
EL_142	19	"""We are a movement waging a just and legitimate struggle for freedom."
EL_142	20	"It is certainly out of the question to target civilians in any way in Turkey,"" the statement, which was carried by Firat news agency, underlined."
EL_142	21	"Finally, the PKK accused the Turkish government of having ""dark plans"" and of ""suggesting Kobani as a target""."
EL_145	1	Le Monde: Erdogan's proximity to Putin is part of his game
EL_145	2	"""Recep Tayyip Erdogan's closeness to Vladimir Putin is part of his game"", notes Marc Pierini, former EU Ambassador to Turkey and researcher at Carnegie Europe, in an article in the French newspaper LE MONDE."
EL_145	3	An article which tries to answer the question whether Erdogan's Turkey should be permanently on the table of the European democrats.
EL_145	4	This is also due to the forthcoming summit of the European political community in Prague, where the Turkish President has announced that he will be present.
EL_145	5	"Analysing the arguments of each side, the article states: The ""no"" camp ""In the ""no"" camp, the arguments are clear: Turkey is no longer a state governed by the rule of law, it constantly maintains an anti-Western and unpredictable discourse, it challenges internationally recognised borders and has provided a significant strategic advantage to the Kremlin by buying the S-400 missiles. ""Looking at the conflict sparked by Moscow in Europe, Turkey is indeed making commendable facilitation efforts."
EL_145	6	It is clear, however, that in this diplomacy, President Erdogan is faithfully adhering to the Russian discourse on the futility of European sanctions and that the economic benefits for Turkey are significant in a context of acute economic crisis.
EL_145	7	"Here, the Turkish president's electoral motives for 2023 are obvious and his proximity to Vladimir Poutine is part of his game. ""Beyond the Russian invasion, Turkey's presence in a future 'political community' is a matter of fundamental European principles."
EL_145	8	"However, internally and externally, Erdogan applies the ""Russian model"" of governance and is often close to Viktor Orban's Hungary."
EL_145	9	"Is proximity to Erdogan justified? ""Is it the appeasement policy endearing to Europeans or the economic and financial interests of some that justify Erdogan's political intimacy with Turkey? ""Objectively, any return, however minimal, to the rule of law would reduce the chances of re-election of a president who has staked everything on the nationalist reflexes of his electorate and the supremacy of his personal role, as evidenced by recent political, financial and judicial decisions."
EL_145	10	"Affinity with the Eurasian authoritarian club. ""Having demonstrated his affinity with the Eurasian authoritarian club, the Turkish leader probably has no intention of getting closer to the European democracies. ""What about the Prague summit? Within the 27, the diversity of views on a ""European political community"" is such that one should not expect full consensus under the Czech presidency. ""The different countries concerned by the EU enlargement policy are in very different situations."
EL_145	11	It is very difficult in these circumstances to find a common denominator.
EL_145	12	This is why it was clearly announced that there will be no formal conclusions at the summit on 6 October.
EL_145	13	"The path to compromise. ""The path to compromise, at least in the short term, probably includes the high priority given, in the summit discussions, to common orientations on the Russian invasion and the principles guiding the participants' reactions."
EL_145	14	"It would already be a remarkable result if Turkey could - in a joint statement with the EU - renew its condemnation of the Russian invasion and make a formal commitment not to facilitate Moscow's circumvention of Western sanctions, a thorny issue. ""Let's forget realpolitik: if the European Union did not clearly reaffirm its democratic principles in Prague, it would disown itself."
EL_145	15	"Thus, Ankara would obstruct the European model by imposing its parameters and would promote the Russian model by consolidating on the borders of Europe the desire to preserve the interests of the Kremlin. ""This would above all be a political victory for the Kremlin against the EU after the military victories of 2019 and 2020 against NATO."""
EL_146	1	50 years since the Olympics and the Munich Massacre
EL_146	2	After the success of the European Athletics Championships in Munich, which was completed last Sunday, there is increasing discussion about the possibility of the country's bid to host the 2036 Olympic Games.
EL_146	3	In particular, the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hendrik Wist, in an interview with the newspaper Rheinische Post, expressed his desire to organise the games in his state.
EL_146	4	However, the terrorist attack at the Munich Olympics, which began exactly 50 years ago today, still haunts the event. 26 August 1972.
EL_146	5	More than 7,000 athletes from 121 countries were in Munich.
EL_146	6	"""That relaxed and happy mood gave you goose bumps,"" football legend Otmar Hitzfeld said at the time."
EL_146	7	First Olympic Games after the Second World War.
EL_146	8	For the first time since World War II, the 20th Olympic Games were chosen to be held in the Federal Republic of Germany 27 years after the liberation from the Nazi regime and 36 years after the Berlin Olympics.
EL_146	9	The symbolism for the choice of Germany was manifold, and especially for the city of Munich, as the Nazi National Socialist Party (NSDAP) was created there.
EL_146	10	The aim of both the political leadership and the organisers was to present a democratic and welcoming country for all.
EL_146	11	For a very short time, the general political climate was forgotten.
EL_146	12	The Olympic Games were a huge success with many medals.
EL_146	13	American swimmer Mark Spitz made history with seven gold medals.
EL_146	14	The hosts also won many medals, such as Heide Rosenthal who received a gold medal in the long jump and Klaus Wolferman, javelin thrower, who not only won a gold medal but also set a world record with his performance.
EL_146	15	The day that changed everything.
EL_146	16	The morning of September 5 was the day that changed everything.
EL_146	17	"Eight gunmen from the Palestinian ""Black September"" organisation managed to enter the Olympic Village, despite warnings to the German authorities about security gaps and a possible terrorist attack."
EL_146	18	They headed to the Israeli delegation building and after killing a coach and a weightlifter, they arrested 9 hostages, while the rest of the athletes and escorts managed to escape.
EL_146	19	The terrorists demanded from the governments of West Germany and Israel the release of 234 Palestinians held by the Israelis, the release of the German terrorists and leading members of the Red Army Faction, Andreas Baader and Ulrich Meinhof, and their safe escape from West Germany.
EL_146	20	Their demands were not accepted by both German Chancellor Willy Brandt and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
EL_146	21	The German state offered to pay a large sum of money to the kidnappers to release the hostages.
EL_146	22	However, they refused and insisted on their terms.
EL_146	23	The hostages were shot dead by the terrorists, along with a German police officer and five of the terrorists.
EL_146	24	"The ""moral"" failure of politicians."
EL_146	25	The reaction of the German special forces was not left untouched, as many doubts were expressed about the way the case was handled and it was argued that a different approach would have avoided the bloodbath.
EL_146	26	"For 32 hours only, the Games were stopped and at the closing ceremony IOC President Avery Bradage sealed the continuation of the event with the phrase: ""The Games must go on""."
EL_146	27	"The then Mayor of Munich, Hans-Jochen Vogel, wanted to believe that the memory of the Munich Games would not be primarily identified with the murderous attack, as he wrote in the preface to the German edition of the book ""Munich 1972""."
EL_146	28	Athlete Heide Rosenthal said that the decision to continue the Olympics was the right one.
EL_146	29	"""We preserved the Olympic ideal of competition without weapons, but in the games themselves."""
EL_146	30	"""To date, no one has ever said 'We're sorry."
EL_146	31	We made the wrong decision.
EL_146	32	"We were incompetent."""
EL_146	33	"They were arrogant and humiliated us all the time,"" Anki Spitzer, a spokeswoman for the victims' families, told ARD."
EL_146	34	It took 45 years to create a place of remembrance in 2017 in the Olympic Park.
EL_146	35	A few weeks before the victims' memorial day, the survivors and their families wanted an apology from the decision-makers, an apology.
EL_146	36	In July, it was announced by the federal government that first-degree relatives would be compensated, but without specifying the exact amount to be allocated.
EL_149	1	"Kiev: Possible to be in Crimea ""by the end of December"""
EL_149	2	Ukrainian forces may be in Crimea by the end of December, according to the country's deputy defence minister, Volodymyr Gavrilov.
EL_149	3	According to the Ukrainian official, an unexpected event inside Russia, such as the sudden collapse of Vladimir Putin's regime, could allow Ukraine to take back Crimea by the end of the year.
EL_149	4	It will be recalled that the Russian Federation annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.
EL_149	5	"""I think Russia can find a black swan in its own country, inside Russia, and that can contribute to our success with Crimea,"" he told Sky News, estimating that Ukrainian troops could ""step into Crimea"" by the end of December."
EL_149	6	"The scenario is ""possible"" and ""not excluded"", he added."
EL_149	7	"When asked what this unforeseen ""black swan"" event could be, he replied that the Russian leader might ""disappear, for example, for some reason"" or be ""someone from his circle, or something might happen, or maybe a combination of a very frustrated society because of their losses""."
EL_149	8	In his interview, Gavrilov also said that the war with Russia could be over by spring, noting that Ukrainian troops would continue to fight through the winter despite harsh conditions and low temperatures.
EL_149	9	"According to him, it is important ""to be prepared for a long battle if Russia is able to strengthen itself""."
EL_149	10	"""Of course, in that case, the war will take a little longer."
EL_149	11	"But my feeling is that by the end of spring, this war will be over."""
EL_149	12	"Asked whether the recent recapture of the city of Kherson made other Ukrainian objectives, such as the recapture of Crimea, more likely, Gavrilov commented: ""It is only a matter of time and, of course, we would like to achieve this sooner rather than later."""
EL_149	13	As for the likelihood of a nuclear attack by Russia, Gavrilov said he believes it is low.
EL_149	14	In any case, he said, this would not prevent his country's troops from fighting.
EL_149	15	"Finally, he reiterated Zelensky's line that peace talks with Moscow could only start if Russian troops are prepared to ""leave every inch of Ukraine"", including the Crimean peninsula."
EL_149	16	"""There is a decision within society in Ukraine that we are going all the way."
EL_149	17	It doesn't matter what kind of scenario is on the table.
EL_149	18	People have paid a lot of blood, a lot of effort for what we have already achieved.
EL_149	19	And everyone knows that any delay or frozen conflict is only a continuation of this war against the existence of Ukraine as a nation.
EL_153	1	Enes Kanter: Erdogan does not represent the Turkish people
EL_153	2	The Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Hieronymos was visited by the Turkish professional basketball player Enes Kanter, who excels in the NBA.
EL_153	3	"The Archbishop asked Enes Kanter what he thought of Greece, who replied that he had visited our country many times, that he felt that ""we are one family""."
EL_153	4	He also stressed that he cannot understand why there is a conflict between the two countries, Greece and Turkey, when we have so much in common.
EL_153	5	His Beatitude pointed out that peoples are beloved and that conflicts are only about people.
EL_153	6	"""May God enlighten all the rulers in Turkey and Greece, even in America, to have a spirit of love and unity,"" he added."
EL_153	7	Enes Kanter then asked for the Archbishop's opinion on the refugee issue and His Beatitude replied that he would prefer to show him what is happening in practice, with the soup kitchens and love parcels sent to thousands of people every day.
EL_153	8	The basketball player was impressed by the charitable and social work of the Church.
EL_153	9	He pointed out that Turks who leave because of the Erdogan government's regime and come to Greece feel the mercy of the Greeks more than their compatriots.
EL_153	10	"At another point, he told the archbishop that he had read and been impressed with his work and added: ""Everyone is praying for you and your health."""
EL_153	11	"In response to a journalist's question, Enes Kanter replied, ""Unfortunately, there are conflicts between Greece and Turkey for political reasons, but I want to say that Erdogan does not represent the Turkish people."
EL_153	12	He added that Erdogan hates Greeks and wants war.
EL_153	13	Because it is before the elections in Turkey, he wants to create a big chaos between Greece and Turkey.
EL_153	14	He also described as unacceptable what is happening in the Eastern Mediterranean, which is illegally searching for oil and wants to invade Cyprus and Greece.
EL_153	15	"He reiterated that Erdogan does not represent the Turkish people and that there are many people who love the Greeks, the Greek culture, their religion and have great respect for it, but ""their foreign and domestic policies are unacceptable and I condemn them""."
EL_153	16	In response to another question, he stressed that he wants to keep talking about human rights.
EL_153	17	"""I don't care what party someone represents, you have to care about human rights, which unfortunately we don't have in Turkey, there is no democracy, no freedom of speech, religion, expression, only protest."
EL_153	18	"Turkey could be the bridge between Islam and the West, but because of Erdogan it is impossible and I hope the Turkish people can see that,"" he concluded."
EL_154	1	Britain: First crisis in the Shunak government over immigration
EL_154	2	First crisis in the government of British Prime Minister Rissy Shunak:
EL_154	3	Interior Minister Swela Braverman is currently facing criticism both for the way she is managing the influx of irregular migrants into the country and for her controversial stay in the ministry.
EL_154	4	"This 42-year-old ultra-conservative -- who recently declared that her ""dream"" is to see illegal immigrants deported from Britain to Rwanda -- is faced with harsh reality."
EL_154	5	Despite promises that Brexit will allow Britain to better manage its borders, the country is facing an unprecedented influx of irregular migrants crossing the Channel.
EL_154	6	Almost 40,000 have made the dangerous journey since the beginning of the year.
EL_154	7	Almost 1,000 migrants arrived in Britain on Saturday alone, according to the Ministry of Defence.
EL_154	8	This was compounded by the situation at the migrant reception centre in Munston, in south-east England, which is overcrowded and has very poor sanitary conditions.
EL_154	9	"The situation there is ""totally unacceptable"", Conservative MP Roger Gale told the BBC."
EL_154	10	"""There are just too many people there and we should never have allowed this situation to arise,"" he added."
EL_154	11	"For his part, the independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, David Neal, referred to ""particularly deplorable"" conditions at the reception centre."
EL_154	12	Initially, the centre was created to provide accommodation for around 1,500 migrants for less than 24 hours.
EL_154	13	However, there are now more than 4,000 people living there, and one family from Afghanistan told Neal that they have been in the centre for 32 days.
EL_154	14	The inspector told a parliamentary committee that there had been four cases of diphtheria among the approximately 11,000 people who had passed through the centre in the past two months.
EL_154	15	Crowding in Munston worsened after 700 people were temporarily moved there yesterday, Sunday, after the migrant reception centre they were staying at in Dover was attacked with Molotov cocktails, leaving two people slightly injured.
EL_154	16	The suspect in the attack was found dead at a petrol station, according to police, with the press reporting that he committed suicide.
EL_154	17	"Braverman referred to ""disturbing"" events in a Twitter post, the only public comment she has made in recent days."
EL_154	18	The head of the Home Office left the Liz Truss government on 19 October after admitting to sending an official document from a personal email.
EL_154	19	But after his appointment as prime minister, Shunak gave her the ministry again.
EL_154	20	"Secretary of State for the Environment Mark Spencer today admitted that there are ""enormous difficulties"" and that there is a need for migrants to be treated ""humanely""."
EL_154	21	In an open letter published today, more than 120 associations and NGOs called on Braverman to create safe routes for asylum seekers and to respect international law.
EL_158	1	Mitsotakis: Any threat against territorial sovereignty must be taken seriously
EL_158	2	"""Any threat against the territorial sovereignty of a country must be taken seriously, especially in the current international circumstances,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in an interview with Le Point magazine and journalist Alexia Kefalas."
EL_158	3	"Asked why the latest threats issued by the Turkish president should be considered serious, he stressed that ""we cannot ignore the fact that these statements confirm an aggressive and expansionist approach towards Greece""."
EL_158	4	"He added that ""Turkish provocations should be analysed in the light of current events: Europe is facing a war on its continent for the first time since the end of World War II."
EL_158	5	"For my country, it is essential to uphold international law, the inviolability of borders and the principle of dialogue as the only means for the peaceful resolution of disputes between countries."""
EL_158	6	On whether he fears that Turkey is behaving in Greece like Russia in Ukraine, Mr.
EL_158	7	"Mitsotakis stressed that ""An armed conflict between two NATO members is in principle unthinkable."
EL_158	8	"However, we should not underestimate the inherent risks of the current situation."""
EL_158	9	"He also said that ""as I have stated from the United Nations and I repeat, the door of dialogue always remains open from my side, on the basis of international law, but I will not accept any challenge to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Greece."
EL_158	10	We would like to have the best possible cooperation with Turkey.
EL_158	11	"However, at this juncture, my only duty is to defend the security of my country by any means necessary."""
EL_158	12	"On defence spending, he stressed that ""it is true that we have exceeded 2% of GDP."
EL_158	13	However, we maintain a careful planning based on our needs and available resources.
EL_158	14	As a member of NATO, we are acting in accordance with the provisions of the 2014 Defence Investment Programme.
EL_158	15	"We do not want, under any circumstances, to enter into an arms race with Turkey, but we are obliged to maintain a deterrent force against any attempt to undermine our sovereignty."""
EL_158	16	"Referring to Turkey's claim that it feels threatened, he said that ""it is irresponsible for Turkey to claim that it feels threatened by our islands, when in fact the exact opposite is the case"" and recalled the invasion of the Turkish army in Cyprus in 1974."
EL_158	17	"On the war in Ukraine, Kyriakos Mitsotakis stressed that ""Greece is always on the side of International Law, Justice and Freedom."
EL_158	18	From the first day of the Russian attack, we supported Ukraine by sending humanitarian and military aid.
EL_158	19	"It was a difficult decision, because Greece has historically and traditionally had ties of friendship with the Russian people."""
EL_158	20	He also analysed our country's strategy in the energy sector and stressed that Greece has become a privileged destination for international investors.
EL_158	21	"""They are attracted by the political stability of the country, but also by its geographical location and its rich human resources,"" he said."
EL_158	22	"On tourism, he said that ""we are working to ensure that Greece can welcome visitors 365 days a year."
EL_158	23	"We are on the right track."""
EL_158	24	On the issue of the 92 refugees and the accusations that our country is receiving from Turkey regarding the refoulement of migrants, he stressed that these accusations are not new.
EL_158	25	"""We went to the border with the leaders of the European institutions to send a clear message to Turkey: the European borders are inviolable,"" he said."
EL_158	26	"And he concluded: ""Turkey has, of course, hosted 4 million refugees on its territory, but that does not mean we can ignore its refusal to respect the provisions of the Joint Declaration signed with the EU in 2016 - all the more so because the Union is providing generous funds to help refugees meet their needs."""
EL_170	1	Coronaeus: The disease can indeed aggravate the heart
EL_170	2	Covid-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, can damage a patient's heart and worsen their condition, a new Chinese scientific study confirms.
EL_170	3	On the other hand, there is insufficient evidence so far that the hypertension drugs one takes can increase the risk of contracting the new virus, according to US scientists.
EL_170	4	The first research, by Chinese scientists from Wuhan University and Renmin Hospital, published in the American medical journal JAMA Cardiology, confirms that the new virus can cause heart complications such as arrhythmia, hypertension, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.
EL_170	5	The study of 416 patients with an average age of 64 years found that during their hospitalisation for Covid-19, one in five (20%) developed a heart problem, which increased their risk of dying in hospital.
EL_170	6	The most common symptoms were fever (80% of patients), cough (35%) and dyspnoea (28%).
EL_170	7	Patients who developed heart problems were older on average and with an underlying disease, mainly hypertension (60%), and more often required mechanical ventilatory support.
EL_170	8	At the same time, scientists in the US, led by Dr Ankit Patel of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who published a paper in the American medical journal JAMA Network Open, argued that there is insufficient evidence so far that two classes of drugs used for hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), may worsen the effects of coronavirus in some patients.
EL_170	9	The question is whether these drugs affect a protein (ACE2), which is considered an 'entry point' (receptor) for the new virus in humans.
EL_170	10	Chinese scientists were the first to report that these antihypertensive drugs may increase the risk of infection with the new virus, but this has not yet been proven, according to the new study.
EL_170	11	According to Dr Patel, similar concerns about coronavirus had been raised for ibuprofen and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), which also interact with the ACE2 protein.
EL_170	12	The researchers stressed, however, that the findings so far are preliminary and doctors should continue to administer these drugs rather than risk creating a bigger health problem, even in people without Covid-19.
EL_170	13	"""Drugs such as ACE inhibitors and ARB antagonists can either be harmful or beneficial in an active infection."
EL_170	14	"We just don't know yet,"" Dr Patel pointed out."
EL_170	15	The European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Cardiology and other scientific bodies, in their statements, stress that there is no clinical or scientific evidence to justify the discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy due to Covid-19 infection.
EL_171	1	Research: What workers are looking for in the pandemic era
EL_171	2	"ManpowerGroup's new survey of 8,000 employees in 8 countries worldwide (Spain, Germany, Italy, Italy, UK, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Germany and the US) reveals that most workers believe that the COVID-19 crisis signals the end of full-time office work and are looking for a ""hybrid"" model combining work and home."
EL_171	3	Workers are primarily concerned about their personal health and that of their families, as well as about returning to the traditional way of working - which marks the loss of the flexibility they have gained.
EL_171	4	"The survey ""The Future of Workers, by Workers: Making the New Reality Better for All"", the second part of the ""What Employees Are Looking For"" series of research highlights the need for employers to adopt a strategy that puts People first and to redefine a future of work that works for both organisations and employees - prioritising responsibilities for health, wellbeing and care."
EL_171	5	"""This crisis started as a health crisis and became an economic and social crisis."
EL_171	6	"While fortunately only a small percentage of the population will be infected by COVID-19, we will all be affected,"" says Jonas Prising, President & CEO of ManpowerGroup."
EL_171	7	"""The data demonstrates how workers around the world feel about returning to the workplace - they are concerned about their health and job retention, and are looking for flexibility that will allow them to better balance their work and home lives."
EL_171	8	"Organisations that prioritise emotional wellbeing and flexibility while creating social impact in these challenging times will be in a better position to attract and retain the best talent, ensuring that employees are healthy, confident and productive."""
EL_171	9	When the economic outlook is uncertain, employability is even more important for workers, with 9 out of 10 saying that keeping their job is a top priority.
EL_171	10	However, how employees feel about returning to the workplace varies by gender and career stage: - Gen Z - Millennials: Gen Z are more eager to return to the workplace to develop their careers and socialize more (51%), while Millennials are less positive (38%); - Gen X - Boomers: Gen X highly value being in the workplace to better focus and collaborate effectively away from household responsibilities.
EL_171	11	Boomers (34%) choose socialising and collaboration as their main reasons for returning to the workplace. - Gender categorization: nearly half of male participants (46%) feel positively about returning to the workplace, compared to a third of women (35%) feeling the same way.
EL_171	12	Women report feeling more anxious or nervous about returning.
EL_171	13	Both men and women rank the top benefits of working from home as not having to move and having the flexibility to work when it is most convenient for them. - Working parents: Male parents cite spending more time with their family as the greatest benefit of working from home.
EL_171	14	Women are more negative about returning to work, with their concern increasing the younger their child is - 61% for children aged 0-5, 53% for children aged 6-17 and 50% for children aged 18 and over.
EL_171	15	"""It is very interesting that the findings of our group's survey, although they concern employees worldwide, are not far from the Greek reality and the demands of Greek employees."
EL_171	16	"Companies need to build trust, listen to their people, respond to their needs and help employees set the right priorities and regain their strengths, says Charalambos Kazantzidis, CEO of ManpowerGroup Greece."""
EL_195	1	New Brussels push for the monopoly of the PPC
EL_195	2	The Commission is unmoved by its positions on the maintenance of PPC's monopoly on lignite and its dominant position in the domestic electricity market.
EL_195	3	Despite official announcements and detailed timetables for the closure of the lignite units by 2023, the Directorate General for Competition insists that Greece has not complied with the European Court's ruling on third-party access to the lignite used by the public company as a monopoly.
EL_195	4	Sources also report that the relevant department of the European Commission has been informed that the European Commission has not yet been able to provide the necessary information.
EL_195	5	Commission has not changed its position on the dominant and dominant position of the company in the domestic electricity market.
EL_195	6	For this reason, as stated in the last report of the enhanced surveillance of the Greek economy, it opposed the government's decision to abolish the NOME auctions.
EL_195	7	"According to Euro2day.gr, DG Comp in the ongoing negotiations with the Ministry of Environment and Energy for the adoption of ""corrective anti-monopoly measures"" -as it characterizes them- insists that fumigation does not open the market."
EL_195	8	And, according to the same sources, it is bringing back on the table other tools in the form of power auctions by the PPP to give its competitors access to its monopoly energy sources, lignite and water.
EL_195	9	The Ministry of Environment, on the other hand, sources say, refuses to implement measures of this nature, arguing that the financial loss suffered by the public company and the slow pace at which the electricity market has opened up.
EL_195	10	Solution with SPV.
EL_195	11	"According to information from Euro2day.gr, in the latest negotiations, which were interrupted due to the holidays, the two sides, the Ministry of Environment and DG Comp, have come close to an agreement on the adoption of a measure which, under certain conditions, can further reduce the shares of DEH, but not ""injure"" its financial situation."
EL_195	12	Sources say Athens has proposed the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) involving consumer-intensive industries.
EL_195	13	In this public undertaking, the company will sell electricity from lignite-fired power plants.
EL_195	14	The power quantities will be purchased by the SPV.
EL_195	15	Their size, sources say, will account for about 10% of consumption.
EL_195	16	The energy-intensive industries, because they have pollution compensation mechanisms, will effectively relieve the PPC from the cost of CO2 allowances and at the same time they in turn will have electricity at competitive prices.
EL_195	17	In this way, the SPV will be able to resell electricity to other energy-intensive industries, thus reducing the public company's share of high voltage.
EL_195	18	"However, according to Euro2day.gr, Brussels believes that this proposal needs ""improvements""."
EL_195	19	That is, electricity suppliers should also enter the SPV, making a more dynamic opening of the market.
EL_195	20	In addition, sources say, in addition to the sale of electricity produced from lignite, they are putting on the table the sale of hydroelectric power.
EL_195	21	However, there is also uncertainty as to how the special purpose vehicle's electricity purchase price will be determined by the PPC.
EL_195	22	According to information, DG COMP proposes the auctions, while the Ministry of Environment disagrees, seeking a fixed price that takes into account the costs of the public company.
EL_195	23	The two sides are expected to discuss these issues again after the holidays.
EL_195	24	Negotiations should be concluded in January and any solution should have a duration of at least until 2023, the year in which all existing lignite plants are retired.
EL_206	1	Carbon emissions are shrinking Earth's upper atmosphere, scientists warn
EL_206	2	Rising levels of carbon dioxide are shrinking the Earth's upper atmosphere, prolonging the life of orbiting space debris, a new study finds.
EL_206	3	Near the Earth's surface, increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere cause temperatures to rise.
EL_206	4	However, in the upper layers of the atmosphere called the mesosphere and thermosphere (MLT), carbon dioxide cools the atmosphere, causing it to shrink and contract.
EL_206	5	This cooling and shrinking process has been assumed for over three decades.
EL_206	6	The new study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres , reveals the first signs that the shrinking of the Earth's upper atmosphere has already begun.
EL_206	7	This means that deactivated satellites and other old technology components in orbit will stay in place for longer due to the reduction in atmospheric drag, filling the area and causing problems for newer satellites.
EL_206	8	"""The debris will remain and will probably increase the likelihood that satellites and other valuable space objects will have to adjust their course to avoid collisions,"" explained geospace scientist Martin Mlynczak of NASA's Langley Research Center."
EL_206	9	The volume of gases surrounding our world is not static.
EL_206	10	It expands and contracts in response to various influences, the largest of which is probably the Sun.
EL_206	11	Of course, the Sun is not static either.
EL_206	12	It goes through cycles of activity about every 11 years.
EL_206	13	We are currently in the midst of the 25th such cycle since the start of dating, a cycle that began around December 2019.
EL_206	14	The previous cycle, number 24, was unusually subdued even at the peak of solar activity, and this is what allowed Mlynczak and his colleagues to measure atmospheric contraction.
EL_206	15	(AGU) The scientists studied the mesosphere, which starts at an altitude of about 60 kilometres, and the lower thermosphere, which starts at an altitude of about 90 kilometres.
EL_206	16	Data from NASA's TIMED satellite, an observatory that collects data on the upper atmosphere, provided information on the pressure and temperature of the MLT from 2002 to 2021.
EL_206	17	In some lower layers of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide creates a heating effect by absorbing and re-emitting infrared radiation in all directions, effectively trapping some of it.
EL_206	18	On the much thinner MLT, however, some of the infrared radiation emitted escapes into space, carrying heat and cooling the upper atmosphere.
EL_206	19	The higher the CO2, the cooler the atmosphere.
EL_206	20	Mlynczak and his team found that the MLT shrank by about 1,333 metres.
EL_206	21	About 342 metres of this is the result of radiative cooling caused by carbon dioxide.
EL_206	22	Since the thermosphere extends over several hundred kilometres, these 342 metres may not seem like much.
EL_206	23	However, a study published in September by physicist Ingrid Knosten of the British Antarctic Survey in the UK showed that cooling the thermosphere could lead to a 33% reduction in atmospheric drag by 2070.
EL_206	24	This reduction in drag could extend the lifetime of space debris by 30% by 2070, the researcher found.
EL_206	25	As more and more satellites are launched into low Earth orbit, this will become an increasing problem, with no real mitigation measures in sight - either to reduce the number of satellites or to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide.
EL_206	26	"""At any altitude, there is cooling and shrinkage that we attribute in part to the increase in carbon dioxide,"" Mlynczak said."
EL_206	27	"""As long as carbon dioxide increases at about the same rate, these rates of temperature change will remain relatively constant, about half a degree Kelvin per decade,"" the researcher concluded."
EL_208	1	EU 27 seek common ground on the energy crisis
EL_208	2	European Union leaders meeting in Prague try to overcome their differences to form a common response to the soaring energy prices caused by the war in Ukraine.
EL_208	3	In a show of European Union unity, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived together at the castle in the Czech capital, with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte following close behind.
EL_208	4	But the picture is not enough to hide the recent tension between Paris and Berlin over energy issues.
EL_208	5	The three leaders were due to discuss the new measures proposed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen with their European counterparts this morning.
EL_208	6	The European economy is fully dependent on hydrocarbon imports and is being hit harder than any other by the supply disruptions imposed by Moscow.
EL_208	7	However, the European Union is again struggling to find common ground because of the huge differences between countries investing in nuclear power, such as France, those dependent on coal, such as Germany, and those historically linked to Russian hydrocarbons in central Europe.
EL_208	8	"""We need better coordination to help our citizens and businesses,"" said Latvian Prime Minister Christianis Carins, warning against attempts at isolated moves following the outcry last week over Berlin's €200 billion plan to protect the German economy."
EL_208	9	"""Under the pretext that a member state can borrow more, it should not be able to subsidise its businesses more, making its neighbours more competitive,"" the Latvian prime minister said."
EL_208	10	"""Show solidarity!"""
EL_208	11	"""Show solidarity!"
EL_208	12	"In difficult times there must be agreement on common measures and not on those that are most convenient for one country,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Moraviecki told the Germans."
EL_208	13	"The Commission President confirmed that ""a cap on energy prices"" will be discussed."
EL_208	14	"""The question is how and for what supplies,"" he added."
EL_208	15	Fifteen Member States, including France, are calling for a price cap on all gas imports into the European Union.
EL_208	16	The scheme is currently rejected by Berlin.
EL_208	17	"""It sounds fine on paper, but it can cause problems,"" warned Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel."
EL_208	18	"We may have a price cap, but we may not have energy because we are not the only customers in the world."""
EL_208	19	Another point of conflict: the reform of the European electricity market that penalises consumers with increased prices based on the price of gas.
EL_208	20	Ursula von der Leyen proposed on Wednesday a temporary cap on wholesale prices for gas used to generate electricity, ahead of the restructuring of the electricity market called for by Paris.
EL_208	21	No major announcement is expected today, as the informal summit is aimed at preparing the decisions to be taken at the forthcoming European summit on 20-21 October in Brussels.
EL_208	22	"""There is no time to lose"" Europeans also need to address the issue of supplier reluctance."
EL_208	23	Twenty-three oil-producing countries, led by Saudi Arabia, announced on Wednesday a drastic cut in production to curb prices, a gift to Moscow and a slap in the face to the West.
EL_208	24	The development underlines the difficulty buyers have in imposing their prices on suppliers, even if they are 'friends'.
EL_208	25	The Commission President also proposes the development of a joint gas market, but also the increase of the 20 billion euro package of European subsidies already approved for the development of the infrastructure needed to decouple from Moscow, while some countries are calling for new reciprocal funding on a European scale.
EL_208	26	"""There is no time to lose,"" warned European Council President Charles Michel, as European employers' associations sounded the alarm at the end of September about the imminent risk of thousands of businesses being unable to survive."
EL_208	27	So far, the 27 have agreed to withhold part of the excess profits of electricity producers for the benefit of consumers, and to jointly impose restrictions on electricity and gas consumption.
EL_208	28	European leaders will today restate their continued support for Ukraine.
EL_208	29	French President Emmanuel Macron said last night that he may announce new arms shipments to Kiev, mainly Caesar artillery systems.
EL_216	1	Lagarde warning: Some fiscal policies create excess demand
EL_216	2	"""We are going through a very difficult period where the ground is shifting under our feet,"" European Central Bank (ECB) chief Christine Lagarde said on Friday, warning that the outlook for inflation will remain uncertain for some time."
EL_216	3	According to Lagarde, precisely because of this uncertainty, what central bankers need to do is to implement a monetary policy that consolidates expectations so that they remain committed to the objective of returning inflation to the medium-term target.
EL_216	4	"""We need to send a signal to the public, to observers, to commentators, that in all scenarios inflation will return to our medium-term target in time."
EL_216	5	"This is the best we can do in the current environment,"" she said in her speech at a conference organised by the Bank of Thailand and the Bank for International Settlements in Bangkok."
EL_216	6	How fiscal policies affect.
EL_216	7	Therefore, in this environment, he warned, the fiscal policies of some European governments could lead to excessive demand.
EL_216	8	Therefore, he noted, fiscal and monetary policy must work in sync for sustainable, balanced economic growth.
EL_216	9	According to her, fiscal policy that is temporary, targeted and tailored can play an important role in protecting Europe from the energy crisis.
EL_216	10	"""These three elements can help mitigate energy shocks and put a ceiling on inflation expectations,"" he said."
EL_216	11	"""Fiscal policies that create excess demand in a supply-constrained economy may force monetary policy to tighten more than would otherwise be necessary,"" he added."
EL_216	12	"""Unfortunately, at the moment, at least some of the fiscal measures that we are analysing from many governments in Europe and particularly in the euro area are pointing towards the latter category,"" she continued, referring to measures that could cause excessive demand."
EL_216	13	Attention to the ECB meeting.
EL_216	14	"The European Commission expects the eurozone economy to contract in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first three months of 2023 due to rising energy prices and ""We need higher investment and structural reforms to remove supply constraints and ensure that potential output is not undermined by the changing global economy."
EL_216	15	"And this is a big question and an uncertainty that we have,"" Lagarde said."
EL_216	16	"""And in a world where external demand is more uncertain, we will also need to boost domestic supply and demand through higher productivity growth,"" he added."
EL_216	17	With inflation running at five times the 2% target, the ECB raised interest rates at the fastest pace on record this year.
EL_216	18	A series of increases in the coming months is also considered likely, given that the price increase will take years to tame.
EL_216	19	All eyes are now on the next ECB meeting, as inflation for November sets the stage for a smaller rate hike than 75 basis points.
EL_216	20	The dollar.
EL_216	21	Referring to the performance of the dollar, Lagarde said that its strength has less impact on the euro area than on emerging economies.
EL_216	22	"""Conventional wisdom will tell you that we are not targeting any exchange rate,"" he said."
EL_216	23	"""Obviously we are watching and being very careful about exchange rate fluctuations and in particular we are watching the appreciation of the dollar very carefully."""
EL_218	1	In solidarity with the struggle of women in Iran, the Bar Association...
EL_218	2	The Nicosia Bar Association of Nicosia in a statement declares itself shocked by the events taking place in Iran and condemns any kind of violence.
EL_218	3	The announcement itself.
EL_218	4	The Nicosia Bar Association (LBA) is shocked by the events taking place in Iran, which became known in the West with the help of the information spread by social media.
EL_218	5	The murder of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the Vice Police for wearing a loose hijab, resulting in her hair being let loose, sparked the civil society movement in Iran against the Iranian regime and gender apartheid, with women leading the movement in defiance of any risk to their lives, with men standing by their side to defend their rights.
EL_218	6	The resistance and fortitude shown by Iranian women is nothing new as they have repeatedly performed acts of self-sacrifice against tyranny and dictatorship and anyone determined to force them into silence, such as Tahirih Qurratul-Ayn, Homa Darabi and Sahar Khodayari.
EL_218	7	We should also not ignore that lawyers like Nasrin Sotoudeh are sentenced to prison for choosing to defend women who are protesting against the obligation for women in Iran to wear the hijab, actions that blatantly violate the right to a fair trial, as enshrined in the ECHR (Article 62), but also Article 1 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted by the United Nations.
EL_218	8	In today's movement we are witnessing historic actions of women who semi-semantically cut their hair, an act that is deeply symbolic as a woman who renounces her hair is not declaring her need but her angry demand for freedom.
EL_218	9	The oxymoron of course for the Vice Police is that at the same time that they deny any involvement in the death of Mahsa Amini, they shoot in cold blood protesters including children and women, including Hadi Najafi and Hananeh Kian.
EL_218	10	'Security' as a key element of public well-being has been repeatedly emphasised in numerous national and international laws, which demonstrates its importance as one of the most basic needs of human life.
EL_218	11	However, the blind violence, which is carried out at various levels and places, without the perpetrators being prosecuted, has caused horror and anger among women and the general public.

EL_218	17	In this context, the necessary arrangements should be made for the return of the looting of the public sector by the three powers as soon as possible.
EL_218	18	Just as the patriarchal traditions infiltrated the interpretations of the Islamic text, these dominant interpretations prevented the much needed changes in the patriarchal traditions.
EL_218	19	In this case, these interpretations legitimised patriarchal customs, where conservative interpretations are often put forward against any attempt to reform the laws or change patriarchal traditions.
EL_218	20	Therefore, a holistic multidimensional approach that integrates all the social, legal and religious foundations of gender discrimination must be adopted.
EL_218	21	We call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that all the principles and rights of the detainees of the recent events are applied without discrimination, seeking to provide a serious basis for dialogue and to meet the demands of the people.

EL_235	1	The European Parliament prepares to take legal action against the Commission - Calls for the link between the Recovery Fund and the rule of law
EL_235	2	Today in the European Parliament a resolution was adopted with 506 votes in favour, 150 against and 28 abstentions, MEPs stressed that the new conditionality mechanism to protect the EU budget.
EL_235	3	However, MEPs pointed out that the Commission has not proposed measures under the new rules and has not met the deadline (1 June) set by the Parliament in its resolution of 25 March to finalise guidelines on the implementation of the regulation.
EL_235	4	"This ""constitutes a sufficient basis for legal action against the Commission under Article 265 TFEU"", the European Parliament said."
EL_235	5	"The risk of misuse of the EU budget in Member States has increased and the situation of the rule of law is deteriorating, Parliament stresses and instructs MEP President David Sassoli to call on the Commission to ""fulfil its obligations"" under the new regulation within two weeks at the latest."
EL_235	6	"""In order to prepare itself, Parliament will, in the meantime, immediately start the necessary preparations for possible legal proceedings under Article 265 TFEU against the Commission"", the resolution reads."
EL_235	7	MEPs call on the Commission to swiftly address the serious breaches of the rule of law in some Member States that seriously jeopardise the fair, legal and impartial distribution of EU funds.
EL_235	8	On this basis, it should use all necessary tools, including the procedure provided for in Article 7 of the EU Treaty, the EU rule of law framework and infringement procedures, to address the ongoing violations of democracy and fundamental rights in the EU, including attacks on the freedom of the media, journalists, and freedom of association and assembly.
EL_235	9	For those who don't know, the conditionality regulation to protect the budget from breaches of the rule of law, which was introduced to protect EU funds from possible misuse by Member State governments, came into force on 1 January 2021.
EL_235	10	However, no measures have yet been proposed under the new rules.
EL_235	11	The European Council asked the Commission to delay its implementation so that Member States can challenge it before the EU Court of Justice (as Poland and Hungary did on 11 March 2021) and until the Commission develops specific guidelines.
EL_235	12	In a resolution of March 2021, the European Parliament reiterated that the European Council's conclusions on this issue do not produce legal effects and set 1 June as the deadline for the adoption of the guidelines.
EL_235	13	MEPs also asked the Commission to consult the Parliament before adopting them.
EL_235	14	At a meeting of the EP committee responsible on 26 May, the Commission stated that it intends to consult with Parliament in the first half of June.
EL_239	1	Russia has accumulated huge revenues thanks to rising fossil fuel prices
EL_239	2	According to a study by an independent think tank published today, Russia accumulated revenues of 158 billion euros thanks to fossil fuel exports during the six months of the war, benefiting from high prices.
EL_239	3	"""The surge in fossil fuel prices means that Russia's current revenues are well above those of previous years, despite reductions in export volumes"", underlines the document from the Finland-based Centre for research on energy and clean air (CREA)."
EL_239	4	Gas prices took off, reaching historic highs in Europe, while oil prices rose sharply at the beginning of the war, although they have fallen recently.
EL_239	5	"""We estimate that fossil fuel exports injected 43 billion euros into the Russian federal budget, helping to finance war crimes in Ukraine"", according to the authors."
EL_239	6	Their calculations cover the first six months of the war, from February 24 to August 24.
EL_239	7	In the period under review, CREA calculates that the main importer of Russian fossil fuels remained the European Union (against €85.1 billion), followed by China and Turkey.
EL_239	8	Progressive embargo from the EU.
EL_239	9	The EU has decided to impose a progressive embargo - with exceptions - on the import of Russian oil and oil products.
EL_239	10	It has also decided to end its purchases of Russian coal.
EL_239	11	But Russian natural gas, on which it is crucially dependent, is not expected to become the object of such a measure for the time being.
EL_239	12	The think tank estimates that the European embargo on Russian coal - implemented on 10 August - has paid off, as Russian exports have fallen to their lowest level since the invasion of Ukraine.
EL_239	13	"""Russia has failed to find other buyers"", according to the authors of the study."
EL_239	14	"Instead, CREA believes that ""stronger"" rules should be put in place to prevent Russian oil from being made available in markets where it is supposedly banned."
EL_239	15	Western sanctions are easily circumvented today, according to this.
EL_239	16	"""The EU should ban the use of European ships and European ports to transport Russian oil to third countries"", he argues."
EL_239	17	It also calls on the UK to ban the participation of the UK insurance industry in such international maritime transport.
EL_239	18	"For their part, the G7 countries decided on Friday to impose an ""urgent"" price on Russian oil, even though it is a mechanism whose implementation involves many complications, in order to reduce the energy manna for Moscow."
EL_239	19	Russia will respond to the imposition of a price cap on its oil by allocating more of its production to Asia, Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov said today.
EL_243	1	"N.Trump creates ""TRUTH Social"" and attacks Facebook: 'M.Zuckerberg is a criminal'"
EL_243	2	"Former US President Donald Trump, a few days after announcing that he is preparing a new social media platform, ""TRUTH Social"", attacked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg."
EL_243	3	"Former US President Donald Trump has called Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a ""criminal"" for donating $400 million to fund local election offices last year."
EL_243	4	"Trump, who lost the presidential election to President Biden, told Bill O'Reilly last week that Zuckerberg's donation to local election offices was ""illegal."""
EL_243	5	He also reported that the funding boosted Democratic turnout in key areas such as Georgia.
EL_243	6	"""Mark Zuckerberg in my opinion, a criminal, is allowed to spend over $ 400 million and therefore is able to change the course of the presidential election and nothing happens on Facebook"" , Trump said in an email -statement to supporters, according to the Independent."
EL_243	7	The hundreds of millions of dollars donated by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan last year were reportedly intended to help election officials who were struggling to secure sufficient funding to implement security precautions and engage voters in secure, in-person voting ensuring that elections would not be disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
EL_243	8	At the time, Facebook's CEO shot down allegations that organizations receiving donations had a partisan agenda after filing multiple lawsuits to block the funds.
EL_243	9	These funds will serve communities across the country - urban, rural and suburban - and will be distributed by non-partisan organizations, Zuckerberg concluded.
EL_243	10	The contribution was distributed to buy masks and gloves for workers and additional equipment to help election officials sort and process ballots, a spokesman for Zuckerberg and Chan said in response to the former president's comment.
EL_243	11	"""When our nation's election infrastructure faced unprecedented challenges last year due to the pandemic and the federal government did not provide adequate funds, Mark and Priscilla provided funding to two nonpartisan organizations that helped cities and states ensure that residents could vote regardless of party or preference."""
EL_243	12	The spokesman also clarified that the funds were not distributed only to Democratic districts, noting that more Republican districts applied and were awarded equally.
EL_243	13	Trump sharpens his attack on Zuckerberg as he launches the new social media platform that aims to provide users with an alternative to Facebook and Twitter without censorship.
EL_243	14	"Last week, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) said it would become a publicly traded company as an alternative to the liberal media and launch its own social network called ""Truth Social."""
EL_246	1	Colombia: Prosecution of former FES chief for over 100 extrajudicial killings
EL_246	2	The Colombian Attorney General's Office will prosecute the former Chief of the Colombian Army General Staff, Gen. Mario Montoya, for his responsibility in 104 extrajudicial killings, part of the scandal known in the Latin American country as falsos positivos ('false positives').
EL_246	3	This scandal unfolded between 2002 and 2008, during the presidency of Alvaro Uribe, when at least 6,402 civilians were killed and presented as rebels by military officers seeking to secure various rewards such as medals, honorary leave, etc.
EL_246	4	This account was made public earlier this year by a special court established under the peace process with the former FARC guerrilla group, the so-called Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz, JEP), which is responsible for the most serious crimes committed during the civil conflict.
EL_246	5	However, organisations of victims and their relatives claim that the actual number of dead is much higher.
EL_246	6	The retired general. Montoya is accused of murders committed between November 2007 and November 2008.
EL_246	7	Among the victims were five minors.
EL_246	8	Although he had received orders from the Ministry of Defence and the chain of command stating that priority should henceforth be given to the arrests of insurgents, Mr.
EL_246	9	Montoya, now 72, did not pass them on to his subordinates and continued to motivate the killing of rebels in combat; for this he will be charged with aggravated manslaughter, according to the attorney general's office.
EL_246	10	"""He continued to evaluate the unit commanders based on the number of combat deaths they reported,"" the attorney general's office document obtained by Reuters news agency stressed."
EL_246	11	"The retired general. ""continued to put pressure on all commanders (of land army units) in the country to comply with his policy on operational results, under which combat deaths were the sole criterion for evaluation,"" the document added."
EL_246	12	Mario Montoya has denied that he committed the crimes of which he is accused.
EL_246	13	His lawyer, Andrés Garçon, speaking to the Colombian press, stressed that the case is being investigated by the JEP, therefore his client is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Attorney General.
EL_246	14	Mr Montoya, who remains at large, was Colombia's chief of the FES from 2006 to 2008.
EL_246	15	He voluntarily appeared before the JEP in 2018.
EL_246	16	Dozens of army officers who had been arrested and convicted in the scandal testified before the special court, in the hope that they would receive more lenient sentences than if they were tried in criminal courts.
EL_246	17	If tried by a felony court, the retired general faces up to 50 years in prison.
EL_246	18	If he is tried by the JEP, he could face a sentence of between five and eight years in prison, which he could serve as an alternative.
EL_251	1	Christos Stylianides will receive Greek citizenship within the day
EL_251	2	Following the official announcement of the appointment of Christos Stylianides as Minister for Civil Protection, the new Minister will receive Greek citizenship.
EL_251	3	Once the name of Christos Stylianidis for the newly created Ministry of Civil Protection was leaked, a procedural issue regarding his citizenship arose and the question was raised whether he would receive Greek citizenship before being sworn in as minister, as the Constitution stipulates.
EL_251	4	The issue was undertaken to resolve the issue by the Minister of State George Gerapetritis and according to government sources the procedural issue will be resolved immediately after the official announcement.
EL_251	5	Therefore, Christos Stylianides will be naturalized as a Greek citizen as a Greek expatriate from Cyprus, while retaining his Cypriot citizenship, as former Deputy Foreign Minister Yannos Kranidiotis did in the past.
EL_251	6	Government spokesman Yannis Economou at 11.30 will make the relevant announcements and will probably announce the Prime Minister's decision to appoint the Deputy Minister, which will be taken over by the former Chief of the General Staff Evangelos Tournas.
EL_251	7	Cypriot politicians in Greece.
EL_251	8	The selection of a Greek Cypriot politician to take up a post in a Greek government is not the first time this has happened.
EL_251	9	Loukis Akritas was the first, who under George Papandreou had assumed the portfolio of the Ministry of Education (1963) and had been elected as a member of the Athens Parliament.
EL_251	10	He was followed by the late Yiannos Kranidiotis, Foreign Minister under Simitis.
EL_251	11	In the Mitsotakis government, however, this is not the first time that a Cypriot has held a key position.
EL_251	12	Nobel laureate Christoforos Pissarides is the head of the Committee of Wise Men for the Recovery of the Greek Economy.
EL_251	13	"""Father"" of rescEU."
EL_251	14	According to the Cypriot newspaper Politis, the main criterion for the selection of Stylianidis by Kyriakos Mitsotakis was his productive and successful tenure at the European Commission, as his contribution in the field of pan-European civil protection is indisputable.
EL_251	15	Christos Stylianides has proven that he can formulate policies and implement them by actively participating at operational level.
EL_251	16	He is responsible for the creation of rescEU, which has significantly upgraded the civil protection sector in Europe, with the participation and synergy of all Member States.
EL_251	17	It is perhaps the most important tool in the field of natural disasters (fires, earthquakes, major accidents) and health risks such as the coronavirus pandemic.
EL_251	18	In fact, it is the institution that establishes European solidarity and gives another dimension to the shaping of civil protection in the 27 Member States.
EL_251	19	It is worth noting that it was one of the 20 biggest achievements of the five years of the Commission under Juncker.
EL_251	20	rescEU has been tested and proved its usefulness in recent disasters in European countries and just last August with the fires in Greece and Cyprus.
EL_256	1	"Apple: asked its suppliers in Taiwan to label their products with the ""Made in China"" label"
EL_256	2	In an effort to avoid the disruption of stringent Chinese customs controls that resulted from US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taipei, Apple is asking that Beijing's customs requirements be followed.
EL_256	3	"According to a Guardian report citing information from NikkeiAsia, Apple has asked manufacturers on the island to label components destined for mainland China as being made in ""Chinese Taipei"" or ""Taiwan, China""."
EL_256	4	These labels are required to comply with a long-established but previously unenforceable rule that requires imported goods to indicate that the island is part of the People's Republic of China.
EL_256	5	"The phrase ""Made in Taiwan"" can lead to delays, fines, and even rejection of the entire shipment under the specific law that China has enacted."
EL_256	6	"However, Taiwan itself requires exports to be labelled with the point of origin: either the name ""Taiwan"" or the island country's official name, ""Republic of China"", terms apparently not recognised by Beijing."
EL_256	7	The choice to require suppliers to deny Taiwan's independent existence has led to criticism from around the world.
EL_256	8	The non-profit organisation GreatFire, which works against Chinese internet censorship, noted that the move was an escalation from an earlier, more relaxed policy by Apple, which removed the Taiwanese flag from emoji keyboards for users in China and Hong Kong.
EL_256	9	"""Is it only a matter of time before Apple starts removing apps whose name contains the characters [for] Taiwan without specifying the 'province of China'?"", the organisation asks."
EL_256	10	Apple is not prepared to lose the Chinese market.
EL_256	11	"""Unfortunately, we suspect that Apple's ""red line"", the moment it will say: ""Stop, no more, we cannot continue to cooperate with the Chinese regime and enforce its censorship demands"", is nowhere near,"" said the GreatFire spokesperson."
EL_256	12	Apple may have felt like it had no choice but to comply with China's demands.
EL_256	13	Shipping delays now would be disastrous as the company moves into the final production phase of the iPhone 14, which is expected to be announced at a press conference next month.
EL_256	14	Supply chain shortages are already starting to bite, the Guardian points out, with the company taking the unprecedented decision, according to respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, to ship the cheaper non-Pro variants of the phone with the same basic microchip that's already in the iPhone 13 at the moment, at a discount.
EL_256	15	India comes into play.
EL_256	16	However, Apple's long-term efforts to diversify its production process are finally paying off.
EL_256	17	According to Kuo, the company expects to ship versions of the iPhone 14 from factories in India along with its Chinese manufacturers on launch day.
EL_256	18	In previous years, Indian factories were months behind those in China and were long behind the production of the company's latest models.
EL_256	19	But this seems to be slowly changing.
EL_256	20	The models produced in India and Brazil for the time being largely serve to satisfy demand in local markets and are not intended for export worldwide.
EL_256	21	For this, Apple's Chinese factories still play an indispensable role as they do in serving the millions of Chinese customers who buy iPhones.
EL_256	22	Thus, Apple seems to have its hands tied for the time being for its presence in the valuable Chinese market.
EL_259	1	Energy crisis: Any day now the ministerial decision on measures to alleviate the inflated bills
EL_259	2	From day to day, without excluding today, it is expected to issue the ministerial decision which will allocate the resources of 400 million euros of the Energy Transition Fund to energy suppliers to finance the inflated bills.
EL_259	3	The government has pledged to subsidise electricity bills with €9 for the first 300 kilowatt-hours for September and €18 from October to December.
EL_259	4	Similarly, in the gas sector, the final form of the formula for a horizontal 15% discount to all consumers, even those who do not purchase gas from DEPA, is expected to be finalised.
EL_259	5	Among the additional measures, the Ministry of Environment has included an extraordinary support to vulnerable households of €40 million, which will be granted to social groups that have difficulties to heat their homes.
EL_259	6	The alternative providers have asked for the state aid to be granted as soon as possible, which will also help them to meet their own obligations which, due to the price rally, are causing serious liquidity problems.
EL_259	7	The government's plan is to provide the support in two instalments, one of which is expected to be paid within the month and the other in December.
EL_259	8	Yesterday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis set the tone for his policy, saying at the Brussels Summit that the government will do everything in its power to prevent the crisis from being passed on to households and will continue to support households and small and medium-sized enterprises for as long as the crisis lasts.
EL_259	9	He also said that it is necessary for the EU to address the problem in a different way.
EL_259	10	Mitsotakis reiterated the possibility of purchasing gas from the European Union and the possibility of increasing gas storage so that there are fewer short-term distortions in the market.
EL_259	11	He added that the Eastern Mediterranean could, under certain conditions, be an alternative source of energy for the European Union.
EL_259	12	Both for the natural gas which can be transported in liquefied form from Egypt to Greece and from there to the European gas network, and for the electricity which can also be produced in North Africa at very favourable prices and transported via a cable again from Egypt to Europe via Greece.
EL_259	13	High fuel prices were yesterday on the agenda of the Summit with decisions on the toolbox of measures being postponed to next Tuesday 26 October at the level of energy ministers.
EL_259	14	In relation to short-term measures aimed at relieving the most vulnerable consumers, the Commission's proposal on the table calls on Member States to make use of part of the revenues they have through emission allowances.
EL_259	15	Interventions are also proposed that could take the form of income support through vouchers or bill payments, or even through targeted reductions in energy tax rates.
EL_259	16	The European Council called on the 27 EU Member States and the European Commission to urgently make the best possible use of the so-called toolbox to provide short-term relief to citizens due to the recent increase in energy prices, the text of the Summit conclusions says.
EL_259	17	"The text calls on the Commission and the Council to ""rapidly consider"" medium and long-term measures to tackle the crisis and on the European Investment Bank to examine how it can accelerate investment in the green transition."
EL_259	18	The issue will then be discussed at the extraordinary meeting of energy ministers on Tuesday.
EL_259	19	A majority of the 27 want natural gas and nuclear energy to be included in green investments.
EL_259	20	The issue of nuclear energy divides the 27.
EL_259	21	"But at yesterday's meeting of heads of state and government in Brussels, ""a very large majority of member states"" supported the idea of including both gas and nuclear energy in the list of viable investments, a European diplomat told Agence France-Presse."
EL_259	22	"Two others confirmed that there is a ""majority"" of countries favouring this proposal."
EL_259	23	At the beginning of October, European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis defended nuclear energy during a meeting of finance ministers.
EL_259	24	"""It is important to recognise the role of nuclear energy as a low-carbon form of energy in our effort"" to reduce CO2 emissions, argued the Latvian."
EL_259	25	"In a report at the end of March, the Commission's scientific service (JRC) noted that ""no analysis has produced scientific evidence that nuclear power harms human health or the environment more than other forms of energy"" which are expected to be included in the so-called green taxonomy."
EL_267	1	More light on climate changes of the distant past with the help of shells
EL_267	2	Scientists can now shed more light on climate changes in the distant past with the help of shells, thanks to a new laser-assisted analysis technique developed at the Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser of the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH) in Crete and used by foreign and Greek researchers.
EL_267	3	The remains of shells that are thousands of years old, often found in large numbers in archaeological excavations around the world, have been used for years by archaeologists to draw conclusions about the life of prehistoric people, their diet, their level of technology, their daily habits, etc.
EL_267	4	The shells can also be used for paleoclimatological studies, in order to make estimates of the ancient climate and its changes.
EL_267	5	The composition of the shells reflects the heat and other properties of the waters in which they live.
EL_267	6	However, the currently available techniques for geochemical analysis of oysters are time-consuming and expensive, making it difficult to study them on a mass scale.
EL_267	7	The researchers, led by Nicklas Hausmann of the German Max Planck Institute for the Study of Human History in Jena, who published the paper in the journal Scientific Reports, have found a new, faster and cheaper method to analyse shells more efficiently using laser technology.
EL_267	8	With the new method it is possible to analyse hundreds of shells from dozens of sites at a time, rather than just a few, as was possible until now.
EL_267	9	"""Being able to compare hundreds or even thousands of shells changes the terms of the game when it comes to building climate models,"" said Hausman."
EL_267	10	"""Shells are a more interesting record than, for example, sediments and ice cores, because they are so closely intertwined with people's lives in the past."
EL_267	11	"If we know what kind of climatic variations the shells went through, we can also get an idea of what people experienced and then, in combination with the study of other archaeological finds, see how people and fauna and flora in general responded to these changes,"" the German scientist added."
EL_267	12	The researchers used the LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) technique to study shells collected from nine different areas of the Mediterranean Sea in Greece, Turkey, Libya, Croatia, Malta and Israel.
EL_267	13	Given known recent climate changes, they were then able to calibrate their technique to make estimates of the distant climate past.
EL_267	14	Apart from Hausman, who had previously conducted research at FORTH Crete, the Greek participants in the development of the new technique included Andreas Lemonis of the Department of Chemistry of the University of Crete, Panos Siozos of FORTH and Dimitris English, an associate professor at the University of Crete and a collaborator of FORTH.
EL_274	1	Β. Kikilias: It is obvious that the Greek people are not listening to Tsipras
EL_274	2	Commenting on Athens' attitude towards Turkish provocativeness, New Democracy's Defence Minister Vassilis Kikilias said that in an election period, national issues should be left out of the internal political dialogue, while Tsipras raised the tone by convening the Council of Ministers.
EL_274	3	"""It is obvious that the Greek people are not listening to him after all the lies he has told,"" he said."
EL_274	4	Kikilias.
EL_274	5	"""Politicians do not have the right to worry, but to act, to anticipate and to prevent."
EL_274	6	"Whoever is in charge has to organize, to strategize and to build a united national front,"" he said, noting that Turkey is in a deep economic crisis."
EL_274	7	"Moreover, the ND Defence Minister added that Ankara is very interested in tourism, while in the energy sector, which is very important for the economy of a country, ""it is looking forward to a fait accompli in the southeastern Mediterranean basin beyond and outside the rules of international law, and especially within the Cyprus EEZ, putting the pseudo-state of northern Cyprus as the front of its arguments."
EL_274	8	Turkey weighs the issues and takes its decisions accordingly.
EL_274	9	"We are interested in what Greece is doing, how we are organized, what the Greek EEZ means, what we are doing, what the European Commissioner for Energy is doing,"" he said."
EL_274	10	We have lent a helping hand on critical issues, such as the refugee issue, and we have respected the national line.
EL_274	11	But it has been shown in recent years that the government has no national line.
EL_274	12	Remember the public confrontations of Messrs.
EL_274	13	Kamenos and Kotzias.
EL_274	14	The past life of the government is not the best with the Prespa agreement, the results that this agreement has produced and the damage it has caused to our national issues.
EL_274	15	In New Democracy we maintain a moderate, cautious attitude.
EL_274	16	We put the country before our party, we are patriotic and we do not take advantage of such a situation at the political level.
EL_274	17	The country's foreign policy and defence require seriousness, stability, robustness and strategy.
EL_274	18	There is no room for pettifogging.
EL_274	19	"The Greek government should have strategically prepared its moves many months ago"", the Athens I candidate stressed."
EL_274	20	Referring to the elections, Mr.Kikilias said that the goal of ND is to convince the entire Greek society that this country really deserves better.
EL_274	21	"""Even our fellow citizens who didn't vote for us in the past, and those who voted for us at some point and were upset with us."
EL_274	22	We are talking about tax cuts at all costs, against the class over-taxation and the dismantling of the middle class by SYRIZA.
EL_274	23	We are talking about security and order in the neighbourhoods of Greece, as opposed to the chaos, disorder and anarchy that prevails.
EL_274	24	We are talking about investments that will create new quality jobs, against the distortion and the permanent problems created by SYRIZA.
EL_274	25	We are talking about a great new patriotism, about the perception that our country is not a place, about our national issues, about our institutions, about our family, about our religion, about all the important things our ancestors fought for and today make us proud and connect us with our tradition and culture.
EL_274	26	These are the four great pillars of our policy.
EL_274	27	Citizens are watching, they are judging and on 7 July they will go to the ballot box to give a resounding message.
EL_274	28	I find it everywhere in the neighbourhoods of Athens.
EL_274	29	I haven't seen such determination and faith in claiming a better life from my fellow citizens in Athens for many years.
EL_274	30	You see that for the first time the opposition is saying less than the government, it has never happened before.
EL_274	31	Mr Tsipras is again promising rabbits with straws.
EL_274	32	"We say little during the election and we will do much more after the election and we will rebuild the relationship between citizen and politician that was broken during the years of crisis,"" he said, adding that Kyriakos Mitsotakis demonstrates moderation, seriousness and understands the criticality of the moments and the anxiety of the Greeks."
EL_274	33	"""He is making his choices with care, with modesty, so that the country can finally be led out of the crisis, so that the average Greek family can prosper, so that our children do not leave abroad and become part of the productive process,"" Mr."

EL_282	1	Erdogan's challenges on Imia and the geostrategic alliance between Greece and France in the Mediterranean
EL_282	2	Recep Tayyip Erdoğan appeared provocative once again, claiming that Turkey had warned Greece not to take actions that would create tension on the day of the Imia anniversary.
EL_282	3	The Turkish president also said that Houloussi Akar contacted Nikos Panagiotopoulos by phone to thank him for the stance taken by Athens.
EL_282	4	"As stated: ""This year we have not experienced a crisis in Kardak (Imia)."
EL_282	5	Why? Because we took a certain attitude.
EL_282	6	We stated that if there is a move like in the past then we will respond differently and you will see that if Greece doesn't do something on Kardak (Imia) then nothing will be done from our side.
EL_282	7	"The Minister of Defence who would probably call the Greek Minister of Defence to thank him and to continue this process in Kardak (Imia) and the other islands."""
EL_282	8	According to information from the Ministry of Defence, the two ministers discussed the de-escalation of tensions in the wider region, while Houloussi Akar reportedly thanked the Greek minister because no action occurred that could lead to tension in the Imia region.
EL_282	9	According to Nikos Panagiotopoulos, in the communication with Akar, the next meetings between the two sides were discussed in the context of open channels of communication.
EL_282	10	The Minister of National Defence said that there was a discussion on the upcoming NATO CSDP Summit in Brussels on 12-13 February 2020, as well as on the continuation of the dialogue on the CFE in Athens between 17-21 February 2020.
EL_282	11	The reaction of the parliamentary opposition was immediate, asking the government for official information on the content of the communication between the two defence ministers.
EL_282	12	In a statement, SYRIZA argued that unlike what the Southwest has done in the past, it will not rely on the statements of the Turkish leadership.
EL_282	13	That is why they are waiting for the government to officially clarify what exactly happened.
EL_282	14	"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for its part, issued a statement in which it said: ""Times do not permit such frivolities and we expect the opposition to rise to the occasion."""
EL_282	15	At the same time, geopolitical poker continues in the Eastern Mediterranean.
EL_282	16	Charles de Gaulle.
EL_282	17	In a highly symbolic move, the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle extends its presence in the Cypriot EEZ, and conducts aerial exercises both in the areas illegally blocked by Turkey and around the floating drilling vessel YAVOIZ.
EL_282	18	"Angelos Syrigos said: ""I have long expected that the French would somehow react."
EL_282	19	The fact that it's over there, I don't think it will prevent the Turkish driller from leaving under the present circumstances, but it sends a message.
EL_282	20	"Perhaps the message is 'we will not allow any more drilling'."""
EL_282	21	The French presence in the Cypriot EEZ is causing irritation in Ankara.
EL_282	22	"On the other hand, Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu said that ""if they continue to deny the existence of Turkish Cypriots, we will respond with similar steps to every negative step taken by the EU""."
EL_282	23	A message to Turkey to de-escalate the tension was sent from Nicosia by the US Assistant Secretary of State, Francis Fannon.
EL_282	24	"""We call on all parties to refrain from provocative actions that could cause further instability and we are steadfast in this,"" he said."
EL_282	25	Meanwhile, Athens continues its diplomatic marathon with Nikos Dendias, after Italy, visiting Malta where he has contacts on bilateral and regional security issues.
EL_282	26	The Foreign Minister's next stop will be Algeria and Tunisia.
EL_288	1	Protest without xenophobia with the exception of Mr.
EL_288	2	Moutzouri The mayors of Mytilene and West Lesvos, Str.
EL_288	3	"Ktelis and Taxiarchis Verros, with the former stressing the need to close the ""abomination of Moria""."
EL_288	4	"""Lesvos cannot continue to be vilified internationally, so that some people in Athens, the rest of Greece and Europe can sleep peacefully,"" Mr."
EL_288	5	Berrus.
EL_288	6	The gathering was completed with a protest march to the closed General Secretariat of the Aegean and Insular Policy, where Kostas Moutzouris signed a protest petition which will be delivered tomorrow morning to the Maximos building.
EL_288	7	The climate in Chios was different.
EL_288	8	In a gathering of 4,000 people, applause was heard only when speakers declared their determination to stick to their refusal to the end of the plans to turn the islands into prisons.
EL_288	9	Contrary to other times, even the deputy regional governor Pantelis Bougdanos and the mayor Stamatis Karmantsis made sure to clarify that the enemy is not the refugees and migrants, but the manipulations of the last two governments, the Dublin Regulation and the EU-Turkey Joint Declaration, whose implementation trapped thousands of desperate people on the islands.
EL_288	10	They also insisted on the framework of the Board's decisions.
EL_288	11	Chios which accepts only one registration structure for newcomers.
EL_288	12	The panel of speakers included the mayor of Oinousses, George Daniel, the mayor of Psara, Kostas Vratsanos, as well as representatives of professional and trade union organisations, who pointed out the need for practical solidarity with the stranded.
EL_288	13	In all three islands the market was dead, everything was closed and people started flooding the squares from ten in the morning, protesting against the government's blackmail against the islanders with the detention of 50,000 people in Moria, VIAL and Samos, offending every sense of justice and humanity.
EL_288	14	The two sides of the concentration in Samos.
EL_288	15	"The participation of Samos' shops in the refugee strike was massive, as well as that of the civil servants in the three-hour work stoppage, but the gathering in Pythagoras Square, with the central slogan ""we want our lives back"", did not exceed the size of previous mobilizations."
EL_288	16	Besides, reservations about the mobilization were expressed by several bodies, in a meeting last Sunday, at the initiative of the municipality of Eastern Samos.
EL_288	17	"""We are asking for the closure of the CST, we are not backing down even a line,"" said in his speech the mayor of Eastern Samos, George Stantzos."
EL_288	18	He called for border security, going so far as to ask for the activation of the European FRONTEX on the Turkish coast.
EL_288	19	And he put forward the demand for compensation and retaliatory measures.
EL_288	20	"The mayor of West Samos Alexandros Lyberis, among others, took issue with the... provocative behavior of organizations that ""can't just slather all over the island, doing whatever they want""."
EL_288	21	The deputy regional governor of Samos, Vassilis Panourakis, called for the government's commitments for immediate decongestion to be honoured.
EL_288	22	The president of the Labour Centre Vasso Vriniotis blamed the current and the previous government for the construction of the new Reception and Identification Centre, in the context of European policies to imprison refugees on the islands.
EL_288	23	The president of the Samos N.T. of ADEDY Stamatis Filippis called for their immediate release and expressed solidarity with refugees and migrants.
EL_288	24	"Participation in the mobilization was the municipal faction affiliated to SYRIZA ""Samos butZEI"", with a different context from the extreme xenophobic poster of the North Aegean region."
EL_288	25	The mobilization was denounced by the Anti-Fascist Movement of Samos, in a joint text with collectives of the other islands.
EL_288	26	The protest goes to Maximos.
EL_288	27	The regional governor of the North Aegean and the mayors of the islands are visiting Athens today to convey the opposition of local communities to the government's plans to create large refugee reception and detention facilities on the islands.
EL_288	28	The self-governors will deliver a petition at the Maximos building and then to the Parliament and the Ministry of Immigration and Asylum, while they will have a meeting with the new minister, Notis Mitarakis.
EL_288	29	"The demands of the resolution include: ""Immediate decongestion and transfer of refugees-migrants to places with humane living conditions."
EL_288	30	No new structures on the islands and closure of existing structures.
EL_288	31	Control of all NGOs.
EL_288	32	Effective maritime border management.
EL_288	33	"Support measures for the islands to repair the damage they have suffered."""
EL_288	34	In a statement ahead of the meeting, the minister described the citizens' indignation as justified and noted that the islanders bear a disproportionate burden and that solidarity at national and European level is necessary.
EL_288	35	"""We need unity, a high sense of responsibility and the cooperation of all stakeholders in order to deal rationally with the migration problem,"" he stressed, referring to the government initiatives aimed at reducing the flow."
EL_288	36	He also noted that the transfer to the mainland of those who are granted asylum or belong to vulnerable groups is being accelerated, without giving any clarification on the new law that provides that the vulnerable remain on the islands and undergo an accelerated asylum procedure.
EL_288	37	"The KIN.ALL. expressed support for the mobilizations of the islands, noting that ""social cohesion is at risk and the far right is lurking""."
EL_296	1	"Iran called on the US to ""stop the violence"" against its people"
EL_296	2	"Following Beijing's ironic announcement, Iran also called on the United States of America to ""stop the violence"" against its own people after the death of African-American George Floyd during his violent police arrest, which sparked outrageous protests in many American cities."
EL_296	3	"""To the American people: the world has heard your voice of oppression."
EL_296	4	"The world is on your side,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said during a press conference in Tehran."
EL_296	5	"""To officials and the American police: stop the violence against your people and let them breathe,"" he said in English, echoing a slogan heard at American protests: ""I can't breathe."""
EL_296	6	"""We are deeply saddened to see the American people, who peacefully seek respect and not violence, being repressed indiscriminately,"" Mousavi added, accusing the United States of ""practicing violence and intimidation at home and abroad."""
EL_296	7	Hundreds have been killed in protests in Iran.
EL_296	8	The American protests are widely covered by the Iranian media, especially by state television.
EL_296	9	Relations between Iran and the United States deteriorated after Donald Trump's 2018 denunciation of the agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme reached in 2015 and the reimposition of tough sanctions against Tehran.
EL_296	10	The United States denounced Iran after the November 2019 riots that followed the announcement of the gasoline price increase.
EL_296	11	Washington says at least 1,000 people may have died in the crackdown on the protest movement in Iran.
EL_296	12	The human rights organisation Amnesty International reported that 304 people were killed.
EL_296	13	"Iran has not released an official account and has admitted the deaths of a very small number of people, mainly in the ranks of the security forces, with the authorities calling the accounts given by ""hostile organisations"" an ""absolute lie""."
EL_296	14	In December, a report by independent experts working for UNHCR estimated that the death toll could be more than 400 (including 12 children).
EL_296	15	The Isna news agency reported yesterday that Iranian Interior Minister Abdulrezza Rahmani Fazil said the riots may have claimed the lives of 225 people.
EL_296	16	"Rahmani Fazil also suggested that 20% of the victims were killed by ""rioters"", in the phraseology used by the authorities at the time."
EL_298	1	Dendias in Sarajevo: Greece firmly supports the European course of the Western Balkans
EL_298	2	Balkans We must not let ghosts of the past haunt and threaten our common future, he added: Our commitment is long-term.
EL_298	3	It is reflected in the Thessaloniki agenda adopted in 2003.
EL_298	4	We remain fully committed to this process, because we believe it is the only way to peace, stability and prosperity both in the region and in the European Union as a whole.
EL_298	5	The Foreign Minister stressed the importance of promoting good neighbourly relations on the basis of international law, a position that Greece has held for decades.
EL_298	6	We are happy to see that, unfortunately, not all, but most countries in the wider region support the same fundamental principles, he said, adding that Greece and Bosnia and Herzegovina agree on this.
EL_298	7	He stressed that the countries of the region should eventually join the EU, of course within the framework of conditionality, and expressed the hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina will take the necessary steps to help it move closer to the EU.
EL_298	8	He underlined the importance of the country being aligned with EU positions and decisions, including those concerning the Eastern Mediterranean.
EL_298	9	Greece has over the years supported and participated in the efforts for the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Foreign Minister noted, adding that the discussions with his counterpart today did not focus on the past, but had the opportunity to examine ways to further strengthen the important bilateral cooperation in all areas, starting with political dialogue.
EL_298	10	As Dendias noted, this is the first visit of a Greek Foreign Minister to Sarajevo in five years.
EL_298	11	During his meeting with his counterpart, as well as in subsequent meetings, particular emphasis was placed on economic cooperation, but also on the further development of bilateral relations in the field of culture.
EL_298	12	He said that Greek is taught in Sarajevo and Banja Luka and expressed the hope that as soon as conditions allow, classes will resume with the physical presence of students.
EL_298	13	Dendias noted that the pandemic is the definition of a global challenge, while it is a test of solidarity and added:
EL_298	14	As we have repeatedly stressed, we must support the countries of the Western Balkans in order to deal with the impact of the pandemic as the European Union.
EL_298	15	In this context, Greece, announced Mr.
EL_298	16	Dendias decided to provide concrete and tangible financial support to three hospitals in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Sarajevo, Banja Luka and Mostar.
EL_298	17	The Foreign Minister said that regional developments were discussed at the meeting, while Mr.
EL_298	18	Dendias referred to the cooperation between the two countries in the framework of the Regional Cooperation Council, which is based in Sarajevo.
EL_298	19	We also look forward to further strengthening this cooperation during the upcoming Greek Presidency of the South East Europe Cooperation Process, which starts in July, he added.
EL_298	20	For her part, the Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed her gratitude to Greece for its continued support for the reconstruction of the country and its efforts to join the Euro-Atlantic Alliance.
EL_298	21	He stressed that the European perspective of the Western Balkans must be a priority not only for the countries of the region, but also for Europe.
EL_298	22	He described the bilateral relations between the two countries as particularly good, but, as he pointed out, there is always potential for further improvement, especially in the fields of economy and energy.
EL_298	23	It is in the interest of our countries to improve the level of bilateral economic relations between Greece and Bosnia and Herzegovina, he said.
EL_298	24	One of the issues discussed with Mr.Dendias was the migration issue, with the Foreign Minister asking the EU to support her country in its efforts to find appropriate solutions to deal with it.
EL_298	25	The burden of the migration crisis must be shared equally across the country, and the necessary measures must be taken to strengthen the country's border security and prevent the entry of migrants, he added: We need the understanding and continued support of the EU.
EL_299	1	Asylum now for Javed Asslam
EL_299	2	The statements of the political world and the signatures of support for the asylum request of Javed Aslam, President of the Pakistani Community of Greece, which was examined yesterday in the second instance, are increasing daily.
EL_299	3	"Members of the ""Asylum for Javed Aslam"" initiative held a solidarity meeting this morning outside the committee's meeting place."
EL_299	4	As the coordinator of the Legal Service of the Greek Council for Refugees, Maria Papamina, noted (left.gr), the committee was presented with important evidence that proves the targeting of Javed Aslam by the authorities of his country.
EL_299	5	She expressed her confidence that the committee will thoroughly examine the evidence and vindicate him and those who support him.
EL_299	6	More than 2,500 signatures of support have been collected by the online campaign through the avaaz platform, more than 500 citizens, parliamentarians, politicians, local elected officials, people of letters, arts, university, the educational community and the trade union movement have signed texts of support.
EL_299	7	In their statements, SYRIZA Secretary Panos Skourletis noted that the Asylum Committee is not only judging whether Javed Aslam will remain in the country, but his journey, his struggles, his ideas, his right to freedom and justice, as well as the values of the Greek state.
EL_299	8	SYRIZA MP and former Speaker of the Parliament Nikos Voutsis noted that the granting of asylum to Javed Aslam is an honour for him and for our country.
EL_299	9	"He underlined: ""Any other development will leave a strong negative imprint on democracy and on the country itself, in addition to the blow to the consciences of the great democratic majority of our people and the immigrants and refugees with whom we live."""
EL_M_013	1	KEY ECONOMIC MEASURES. (1) Child benefit: For all children of Greek nationals with tax residence in Greece, under the age of 18.

EL_M_013	12	Participation of patients' contribution for medicines at 10%.
EL_M_013	13	Abolish the Katrougalos law, restore widow's pensions to previous levels and ensure decent pensions, fully contributory. (7) Red bank loans: Zeroing out the loan if the owner surrenders the house to the bank.

(10) Minimum wage: increase by €100 and then annual adjustment, slightly lower than worker productivity and inflation, to continuously improve the competitiveness of the economy.
EL_M_014	1	The immigration issue is one of the many black spots of the SYRIZA - ANEL Government, which has not been solved, but instead has been inflated by the policy of NEA DEMOCRACY.
EL_M_014	2	It is capable of dynamiting the foundations not only of the Greek Society but of the entire Greek State and Hellenism as a whole!
EL_M_014	3	Illegal immigration has always been a thorn in the side of every Greek Government.
EL_M_014	4	In Greek cities where hotspots have been created, despite the fact that crime has increased dramatically, the State is indifferent and Greeks are permanently exposed to criminal elements.
EL_M_014	5	"The State now talks openly about the ""integration"" of these people into Greek society, while constantly announcing new measures to provide them with free accommodation, food, facilities (computers, Internet, etc.), education and even access to the labour market."
EL_M_014	6	In 2019, asylum applications in Greece amounted to 75,000 and in Europe as a whole to 612,700 (of which 23,700 from Afghanistan, which is no longer at war, and 10,700 from Syria).
EL_M_014	7	Our country received the most applications after Germany and France.
EL_M_014	8	The other countries in the path of illegal immigration (Bulgaria, Spain, Italy) have closed their borders or are accepting far fewer.
EL_M_014	9	Spain has been vindicated by the European Court of Human Rights for summary repatriations in the waves of attacks by trafficking rings in Africa.
EL_M_014	10	Let's not fool ourselves.
EL_M_014	11	We are talking here about organised migration.
EL_M_014	12	Especially when no limits are set even for refugees.
EL_M_014	13	After all, many come from non-war zones, far away from our country.
EL_M_014	14	Once they enter from a safe country, such as Turkey, the designation does not apply.
EL_M_014	15	Especially in the case of Turkey, we are talking about a Hybrid War to destabilize the country and our borders, as was clearly demonstrated in the Evros incidents, with constant blackmail for EU funds and coverage by mainstream media.
EL_M_014	16	Turkey provokes, threatens, oppresses and instead of sanctions receives funding from the EU, while much of the money to tackle migration has become coastguard boats and armoured vehicles harassing our fishermen and border guards.
EL_M_014	17	Provision should be made for the possibility of setting a ceiling on the granting of protection and asylum.
EL_M_014	18	For example, in the US of 330 million people there was a limit of 110,000 applications under Obama, which Trump has gradually reduced to 18,000, and these applicants are also staying in special closed facilities.
EL_M_014	19	"The US cap of 10 million would correspond to 900 people per year in Greece, while the more ""generous"" cap of 110,000 during the Obama presidency corresponds to 3,300 people."
EL_M_014	20	Otherwise, with an open border Greece is a magnet for non-beneficiaries.
EL_M_014	21	Where does the misery of the billions of this world and the misery of the 10 million Greeks begin? How can our country not be a magnet, then, when benefits and housing are provided through the ESTIAS programme? When in this way sums of money flow to NGOs, suppliers and property owners, resulting in rising rents even in the midst of a crisis? It is something that POMIDA has also admitted, that it contributes to the increase or maintenance of rents, at the same time as Greeks are being thrown out on the street through auctions.
EL_M_014	22	The ESTA's housing population is at least 25,000 with €92 million of EU funding for 2021.
EL_M_014	23	But until when will these be provided? On the other hand, deportations are practically not even for criminals.
EL_M_014	24	Only 4,868 took place in 2019, according to the Ombudsman's Report, with the largest number of departures being to neighbouring Albania.
EL_M_014	25	Of course, with all this, there are large sums at stake.
EL_M_014	26	Between 2015-2019 Greece has been allocated 2.2 billion euros from the EU for migration flows, of which 96 million euros to the State and the rest to UN agencies, which were then shared with other NGOs.
EL_M_014	27	"These are the ""legal"" amounts."
EL_M_014	28	In addition, in 2015 alone more than 5 billion euros were collected by traffickers according to Interpol data.
EL_M_014	29	ELLINIKI LYSI has called for the registration and control of NGOs.
EL_M_014	30	We monitor expenditure and find mismanagement.
EL_M_014	31	"In NGO surveys so far, NGOs have been found that declared a cost of €2,000 for each ""unaccompanied minor"" they hosted!"
EL_M_014	32	In addition, NGO members have been arrested for spying in border areas, while among the foreigners there are dangerous jihadists.
EL_M_014	33	"At the same time there are allegations of NGOs exploiting workers (what the GSEE calls ""labour exploitation"") in violation of labour legislation."
EL_M_014	34	Therefore, we are talking about an uncontrolled situation in the country.
EL_M_017	1	Our vision for Greece and Europe.
EL_M_017	2	We envision a Greece and a Europe, democratic, where political and economic power comes from the many (who are the poorest), not from the interconnected oligarchs.
EL_M_017	3	Ecclesiology, with each opinion being judged on the basis of its merit and not on the basis of who expressed or promoted it.
EL_M_017	4	"Social, which recognises that the culture of a society is reflected in the way it treats its weaker members, the ""other"", the ""different""."
EL_M_017	5	Free Citizens, with their freedom not limited to the absence of repression and the prevention of outside interference but, at the same time, offering (a) protection from the exploitation created by class society, and (b) equal access to health, education and welfare, which is essential for the cultivation of the personality of citizens.
EL_M_017	6	Realistic, setting achievable economic, social and cultural goals.
EL_M_017	7	Innovative, committed to open research and free access to its results for the benefit of science, the diffusion of applications, the environment and collective knowledge; anti-monopolistic, aware that the concentration of economic power undermines not only democracy but also prosperity.
EL_M_017	8	Tolerant, where everyone has the maximum degrees of freedom in their actions and choice of partners and companions in their work and personal life.
EL_M_017	9	Equality of opportunity, which requires a multi-level, continuous struggle against social, ethnic, racial, sexual discrimination.
EL_M_017	10	Decentralized & Pluralistic - a Greece and a Europe of regions, of nationalities, of different philosophical beliefs, of different languages and cultures, of self-determination of individuals and groups.
EL_M_017	11	"Civilisation, enriched by cultural diversity and proud not only of the achievements of our long tradition but also of the creativity of contemporary, even ""heretical"", creators.Participatory, using central power to ensure democratic, participatory administration in workplaces, cities and regions."
EL_M_017	12	Open, because it knows that walls, barbed wire and border fences are not appropriate for proud peoples with confidence and dignity.
EL_M_017	13	Sustainable, which recognises the limits of Nature, minimising the ecological consequences of its domestic activities; Ecological, which sets as an objective of its foreign policy the respect of the planet's ecosystems, the protection of biodiversity, and the global transition to green forms of energy, transport and production.
EL_M_017	14	"Peaceful, which de-escalates tensions, promotes common civilisation as a geopolitical tool for resolving differences, and acts as a bulwark against destabilising forces, expansionist tendencies, any kind of irredentism on European soil, as well as the sirens of militaristic ""solutions""."
EL_M_018	1	We do not stay in Europe, we are Progressive Europe!
EL_M_018	2	As the flesh of the flesh of the authentically pan-European, internationalist progressive movement DiEM25, MERA25 points out the extreme anti-Europeanism of those who identify Europe with the Unholy Alliance (of the deep Northern European Establishment and the oligarchs of the South) that is destroying it.
EL_M_018	3	"The so-called Europeanists who scare the Greeks that ""Europe"" will punish them if they dare to do the SEVEN TOMES that common sense demands, obviously have a very bad view of Europe!"
EL_M_018	4	Europe, which DiEM25 is fighting for, is one with us and is fighting against the Unholy Alliance that is destroying Europe today.
EL_M_018	5	MPA25 will not accept policies that condemn Greeks for the benefit of alleged European interests.
EL_M_018	6	Nor will it ever propose policies that aim to benefit Greeks at the expense of other peoples of Europe or other fellow human beings wherever they live, wherever they come from.
EL_M_018	7	The policies we propose will always be in line with those proposed by DiEM25 for the benefit of all European peoples at the same time - policies that will allow Greeks to breathe in a European Union that is morally recovering, and as a source of solutions, in the eyes and minds of European democrats.
EL_M_018	8	As an internationalist front, MPA25 sees the interests of Hellenism as fully aligned with the needs of our persecuted fellow human beings from all over the world.
EL_M_018	9	It will never accept European policies - such as the scandalous EU-Turkey agreement - that harm the humanity of Europe and the soul of Greeks.
EL_M_018	10	Many say that deconstructing this authoritarian EU may be the solution.
EL_M_018	11	It's not!
EL_M_018	12	No matter how shaky the foundations of the EU are, no matter how much it was founded as a cartel of industrialists and bankers, no matter how authoritarian it is, the deconstruction of the EU giganticizes intolerance, reinforces deflation, and premiumizes the most misanthropic political forces of our continent.
EL_M_018	13	This is why, today more than ever, progressive democrats are required to act as radical Europeanists.
EL_M_018	14	Others insist that the deconstruction of this authoritarian EU is inevitable.
EL_M_018	15	They may be right.
EL_M_018	16	The European Union will either be democratised or it will dissolve.
EL_M_018	17	In both cases, Greece must stop suffocating.
EL_M_018	18	Greek democrats will fight hand in hand with the democrats of the rest of Europe, whether the European Union is dissolved or not.
EL_M_018	19	This is the project in which MP25 is involved by choosing the strategy IN & AGAINST: Within the EU.
EL_M_018	20	Against this EU!
EL_M_022	1	MIGRANTS IN GREECE.
EL_M_022	2	MPA25 notes that.
EL_M_022	3	The separation of migrants and refugees is outdated and unacceptable for civilized countries, especially when they have our ancient tradition of hospitality: When our fellow human beings choose to risk their lives and the lives of their loved ones, in deplorable circumstances, to reach our shores, it makes no difference whether their motive was the fear of a bullet or the terror that their child would starve to death 2.
EL_M_022	4	The EU-Turkey agreement is the refugee problem itself, not the solution.
EL_M_022	5	It prevents political refugees and people with high needs from being registered as such and places bureaucratic obstacles on them and their helpers, keeping refugees, organisations working for them and local communities in uncertainty, not allowing them to plan the integration or not of these people. 3.
EL_M_022	6	Greek society has reacted to the humanitarian drama of the last few years with a combination of incredible solidarity for refugees, desperation of local communities, and a small portion who seized the opportunity to gain power and voice through the cultivation of xenophobia and racism. 4.
EL_M_022	7	On the one hand we have the planned impoverishment of these people as a means of preventing new arrivals and on the other hand we have an established lack of solidarity towards the inhabitants of Lesbos, Chios, the islands that receive the refugee flows, which have been turned into prison islands.
EL_M_022	8	A country like Greece, which has experienced in the skin of its citizens refugees, migration and pride in our Diaspora, has an obligation to create opportunities for immediate, real integration for the migrants living here.
EL_M_022	9	MPA25 will create a nationwide network of solidarity for refugees, with the creation of many, small, human infrastructures throughout the country for the decent accommodation and living of refugees, for the proper reception of these tens of thousands of people who are currently seeking asylum, while giving breath to the Aegean islands that government and European policies have turned into concentration camps for souls.
EL_M_022	10	MPA25 will establish a Consultative Assembly of Migrants (ACM) elected by the migrants themselves for their own, organized expression - with democratic procedures that will be taken care of by the Greek state.
EL_M_022	11	Government, Opposition and other institutions will no longer be able to treat migrants as an amorphous, mindless human mass whose views are not recorded and have no ability to intervene in the decisions and policies that oppress so many lives.
EL_M_022	12	MP25 will legislate to provide permanent work/residence permits to anyone who has spent two years in the country as a worker, to anyone who has spent ten years without working, to all children born in the country to the above groups, and to start the citizenship process within two years for those with permanent work/residence permits.
EL_M_022	13	"MPA25 will withdraw the country from the unacceptable and illegal under international law EU-Turkey Agreement, will veto any corresponding decision, and will oppose any militaristic ""solution"" (e.g. bombing Syria) that reproduces the refugee problem."
EL_M_023	1	"EDUCATION: MPA25 believes that the degradation of education and literacy in ""Greece's serfdom"" is so deep, and its roots so strong, that no government can bring about the educational revolution that is needed."
EL_M_023	2	At least eight pathologies require a cross-party approach that transcends the partisan debates inside and outside Parliament: 1.
EL_M_023	3	"The atavistic attachment of students and their families to the ""institution"" of the tutorial, even when it is clear that it offers nothing 2."
EL_M_023	4	"Society's addiction to the passive reproduction of information, which it even identifies with the ""objective evaluation"" of our young people 3."
EL_M_023	5	The relative indifference of our society to the quality of education they acquire from schools and universities in relation to the ardent desire for (ultimately) discredited diplomas and degrees 4.
EL_M_023	6	A society that ignores the crucial difference between information and skill, education and literacy, and knowledge and wisdom 5.
EL_M_023	7	Left-wing student factions insisting on labour rights that are impossible for universities to deliver within a capitalist system that systematically generates unemployment and underemployment (Note.
EL_M_023	8	If that were possible, then why are they opposed to capitalism?) 6.
EL_M_023	9	Conservative student factions that talk about excellence when they invest in the transaction and collude with professors and interests that breed inequalities 7.
EL_M_023	10	Low-paid professors who support parasitic research projects that ultimately legitimize their low salaries but at the same time protect them from competition from professors who would come from abroad if the salaries were higher 8.
EL_M_023	11	Dominance of a perverse concept of meritocracy that, in fact, masks the reality that, in the end, it is the privileged children who thrive on the basis of a brutal class reproduction.
EL_M_023	12	All these pathologies require the creation of a long-term, non-partisan national council that will plan, and propose to Parliament, periodic reforms in the field of education.
EL_M_023	13	MPA25 will establish a Candidates & Elected Citizens Consultative Council (CICC) for Formation & Education.
EL_M_023	14	The Education & Training Committee will formulate education policy through a continuous, non-partisan dialogue involving citizens beyond the education guilds or parties.
EL_M_023	15	In order to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the DISCEP FORMATION & EDUCATION, its members will consist of 300 citizens, of which 100 will be selected by lot from the active teachers of the country (10 kindergarten teachers, 30 primary school teachers, 30 high school teachers, 30 university teachers), 100 will be selected by lot from the total population of the country (all with rolling two-year terms), while the remaining 100 will be nominated by the parliamentary parties according to their electoral strength.
EL_M_023	16	The 300 will elect the 9-member Bureau of the FORMATION & EDUCATION JACEP consisting of 3 members from each of the three hundreds.
EL_M_023	17	Every quarter, the FORMATION & EDUCATION DISCEP will convene for an intensive three-day conference on a specific topic.
EL_M_023	18	On this issue, policy proposals will be put forward by the representatives in the FORMATION & EDUCATION DISCIPLE of the government and opposition parties (as well as experts who will support their positions), while the members of the FORMATION & EDUCATION DISCIPLE will be able to raise questions, propose counter-policies, etc.
EL_M_023	19	At the end of the conference, on the basis of the in-depth discussion, the FORMATION & EDUCATION DISCIPLE will take concrete decisions.
EL_M_023	20	The government will then be able to submit them to the Parliament for a vote, if it agrees with them.
EL_M_023	21	Otherwise, if the Education & Training Committee comes to the same decision after two years, then the government is obliged to submit it to the Parliament, even if it disagrees, where an enhanced majority will now be needed to prevent the recommendation of the Education & Training Committee from becoming a law of the state.
FR_001	1	OPEC ready to accept Iran's return to the oil market
FR_001	2	With the world economy gradually deconflicting, OPEC is confident of a sustainable recovery in oil prices.
FR_001	3	The lifting of U.S. sanctions against Iran and its return to the export league are unlikely to change this.
FR_001	4	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) approached its June 1 meeting by videoconference with confidence, with the OPEC basket price (which aggregates the prices of crude references from the 13 members) at $62.16 (€50.76), its highest since the March 2020 fall to around $16 (€13).
FR_001	5	The second meeting of the day, in the OPEC + format which brings together 10 non-member countries, led by Russia, with the 13 members of the cartel, did not call into question the expected conclusions: OPEC and its partners will wait until the next meeting in July to possibly go beyond the commitments made in April to gradually increase OPEC's supply by 2 million barrels per day after the sharp cuts decided in April 2020.
FR_001	6	According to the organization, global daily oil demand is set to grow, on average for the whole of 2021, by 6 million barrels, or 6.6%, to reach 96.5 million barrels.
FR_001	7	But OPEC expects a fourth-quarter increase of up to 100 million barrels per day, which would bring global oil demand back to pre-pandemic levels.
FR_001	8	Understandably, the organization is not alarmed by the two main factors currently likely to derail this scenario: the Indian health crisis and the possible lifting of US sanctions against Iran.
FR_001	9	As for India, the world's third-largest oil importer and therefore a major player in price formation, the net slowdown caused in the first half by the epidemic outbreak should be offset by rising demand in China and the United States.
FR_001	10	In addition, on the day of the OPEC meeting, the Indian government announced that its daily vaccination capacity would be increased from the current three million doses per day to ten million by early July.
FR_001	11	Iran's expected return As for Iran, even though the country has accumulated substantial reserves for over two years, during which time US sanctions prevented it from selling its oil easily, its return to the market, thanks to increased global demand, should have no influence on prices.
FR_001	12	In this regard, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo of Nigeria told the videoconference that the expected return of Iranian production and exports would be orderly and transparent, and would not jeopardize the relative stability achieved since the April meetings.
FR_002	1	Concern about the rapid reduction in central bank liquidity injections.
FR_002	2	"On the Capital magazine website in today's column entitled ""gare à une réduction rapide des injections de liquidité des banques centrales!"""
FR_002	3	Christopher Dembik, French economist and director at Saxo Bank, looks at the evolution of central bank liquidity injections.
FR_002	4	A rapid reduction is likely to weigh on global economic activity... and the stock market, in his view!
FR_002	5	At Saxo Banque, we believe that in an environment where central banks have all the power in the world, it is very important to follow the evolution of their liquidity injections in order to make informed investment decisions.
FR_002	6	In the wake of the pandemic, central banks around the world opened the liquidity tap to avoid a liquidity crisis.
FR_002	7	According to our estimates, central bank liquidity injections peaked at 12.5 percentage points of global GDP during the pandemic.
FR_002	8	This is six times more than the peak reached at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.
FR_002	9	Now that the world is being hit hard by inflationary pressures stemming from production shortfalls, labor shortages and the energy crisis, central banks are beginning to scale back their liquidity injections.
FR_002	10	They continue to inject them, but on a much smaller scale.
FR_002	11	According to our estimates, central bank liquidity injections represented around 3 percentage points of global GDP in the third quarter.
FR_002	12	The European Central Bank was the biggest contributor to central bank liquidity injections, with a liquidity injection rate of 1.8 percentage points.
FR_002	13	"Next come the US Federal Reserve (0.9%) and the People's Bank of China (0.2%). ""Tapering"" is the Anglo-Saxon name given to this ""reduction"" in liquidity injections."
FR_002	14	It's the act of reducing.
FR_002	15	The problem is that reducing the amount of liquidity injected obviously reduces the rise in stock market prices.
FR_002	16	"In fact, according to the folks at Saxo Bank, ""we believe that the massive injections of liquidity by central banks, which have flooded the financial markets, largely explain the excellent performance of equity markets in recent months."
FR_002	17	As a result, the rapid reduction in liquidity injections by central banks is likely to weigh on global economic activity, weighing on the performance of financial markets over the medium to long term.
FR_002	18	With new confinements looming in Europe, we're not out of the woods yet, be they sanitary or economic.
FR_006	1	Inflation: US ready to end tariffs on Chinese imports (Biden)
FR_006	2	US President Joe Biden said in Tokyo on Monday that he was considering lifting tariffs on China, stressing that they had not been imposed by his administration.
FR_006	3	"Joe Biden: ""We didn't impose these tariff barriers""."
FR_006	4	The announcement will startle Donald Trump.
FR_006	5	On Monday, US President Joe Biden said in Tokyo that he was considering lifting tariffs on China, stressing that they had not been imposed by his administration.
FR_006	6	"""We have not imposed these tariff barriers,"" he said when asked by the press about the possibility of lifting them, adding that their removal was ""under consideration""."
FR_006	7	"The comments come as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that some of the tariffs put in place under former US President Donald Trump against imports from China ""hurt American consumers and businesses and are not very strategic""."
FR_006	8	"""They don't address the real issues we have with China, whether it's supply chain vulnerabilities, national security issues or other unfair trade practices,"" the Secretary of State had noted, speaking to the press ahead of a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Germany. 350 billion in imports."
FR_006	9	U.S. tariffs on $350 billion of imports from China will automatically expire on July 6, if no company asks to maintain them, and the Biden administration is under pressure to remove them due to record inflation in the U.S.
FR_006	10	The main employers' federation (US Chamber), companies and international trade experts have been calling for months for these measures to be eased or even abolished, arguing that they hit small businesses hard as they have no alternative sources of supply.
FR_006	11	"""We are in the process of having these discussions"" on the future of tariffs, added Janet Yellen."
FR_006	12	"The former Republican president had taken these measures in retaliation for Chinese trade practices deemed ""unfair"", denouncing the ""theft"" of intellectual property or the ""forced"" transfer of technology."
FR_006	13	In Davos, the IMF defends globalization.
FR_006	14	These comments come at a time when the IMF will be defending globalization at Davos and urging countries not to give in to the temptation of protectionism.
FR_006	15	"""As policymakers and business leaders head to Davos, the global economy may be facing its biggest test since the Second World War,"" International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and the institution's Number 2 Gita Gopinath opined on Sunday in a blog they co-authored with Strategy Director Ceyla Pazarbasioglu."
FR_006	16	The meeting will be largely dominated by the war in Ukraine and its consequences, including the global food crisis.
FR_006	17	"There is a ""greatly increased risk of geo-economic fragmentation"", stress IMF officials, contrasting this with the benefits of globalization."
FR_006	18	"""Over the past three decades, flows of capital, goods, services and people have transformed our world, aided by the spread of new technologies,"" they write."
FR_006	19	"""These forces of integration have boosted productivity and living standards, tripling the size of the global economy and lifting 1.3 billion people out of extreme poverty,"" they continue."
FR_006	20	Lowering customs barriers would alleviate shortages.
FR_006	21	Today, this progress is threatened as the war in Ukraine is accompanied by sanctions and restrictions.
FR_006	22	The IMF notes that since the start of the war in Ukraine on February 24, some 30 countries have restricted trade in food, energy and other essential raw materials.
FR_006	23	"Yet ""strengthening trade to increase resilience"" is essential."
FR_006	24	Lowering trade barriers would alleviate shortages and bring down the price of food and other products.
FR_006	25	"The IMF also recommends that countries and companies diversify their imports to secure supplies ""and preserve the enormous business benefits of global integration""."
FR_008	1	Competition: raids in the print media distribution sector
FR_008	2	The French Competition Authority suspects that they may have entered into agreements or concerted practices concerning the tender for the concession to deliver recognized newspapers and magazines in Belgium for the period 2023-2027.
FR_008	3	A spokeswoman for publisher DPG Media (Het Laatste Nieuws, De Morgen, Dag Allemaal, Humo, ...) confirmed that the Competition Authority had visited the site on Monday, but was unable to provide any further information.
FR_008	4	Anti-competitive practices.
FR_008	5	The search is a preliminary step in the prosecution of anti-competitive practices and in no way prejudges the outcome of the ongoing investigation, stresses the ABC, which has not commented on the possible duration of this investigation.
FR_008	6	"Last month, bpost announced that it had carried out a ""compliance review"" of its newspaper distribution concession, revealing possible misappropriation of the contract in the form of collusion between bpost and publishers."
FR_008	7	This has prompted CEO Dirk Tirez to take a step aside, while an audit is carried out to shed light on the whole affair (the conclusions of which are not yet known).
FR_008	8	On Tuesday morning, however, a bpost spokeswoman said that no searches had been carried out at the company.

FR_009	1	Bercy steps up its fight against tax fraud
FR_009	2	Six months after the adoption of the Anti-Fraud Act, on Wednesday Bercy officially set up its Service d'Enquêtes Judiciaires des Finances (SEJF), a new body of inspectors tasked with fighting tax crime more effectively.
FR_009	3	The Finance Judicial Investigation Department is made up of 266 authorized investigators, including 241 judicial customs officers and 25 judicial tax officers.
FR_009	4	"These agents are specially empowered to carry out judicial police missions, and have all the prerogatives made available to them by the Code of Criminal Procedure,"" the Ministry stated in a press release."
FR_009	5	"Bercy's ""armed wing""."
FR_009	6	"Created within the Ministry of Action and Public Accounts, this so-called ""tax police"" unit can be called in for cases requiring cutting-edge tax or financial expertise, and involving considerable financial stakes, according to Bercy."
FR_009	7	Some 25 agents, trained for six months at the Tourcoing (Nord) customs school, have so far taken up their duties at the SEFJ premises in Ivry-sur-Seine (Val-de-Marne).
FR_009	8	Fifteen more will join them in the coming months.
FR_009	9	"A total of ""40 forensic tax officers will be on the job this year"", emphasized Gérald Darmanin, Minister of Public Accounts, at a press conference, saying he wanted to make this service Bercy's ""armed wing"" in the fight against fraud."
FR_009	10	"""These are tax agents who, under the authority of a magistrate, will be able to search, geolocate, take people into custody, conduct hearings, wiretap, seize assets or property they discover,"" he insisted."
FR_009	11	Fraud is less and less accepted.
FR_009	12	The SEFJ may be seized in particular by the Parquet national financier (PNF).
FR_009	13	It will complement the National Judicial Customs Service (SNDJ) and the new Judicial Police Sub-Directorate in charge of financial investigations, which was set up on Monday.
FR_009	14	"These tools were ""lacking"", because ""the schemes of tax evaders are increasingly complex"", Gérald Darmanin asserted, pointing out that ""the car of the tax authorities or the car of the gendarmes"" sometimes doesn't go ""as fast as the car of the thieves""."
FR_009	15	"""The tax officers will have an accounting role, obviously: to recover the money that's missing from the state budget""."
FR_009	16	"But beyond that, ""they will have a social role"", because ""tax fraud is something that is less and less accepted by our fellow citizens"", added the Minister."
FR_009	17	According to the Solidaires finances publiques trade union, between 80 and 100 billion euros in taxes are lost to the State every year as a result of these fraudulent practices.
FR_009	18	However, there are no official estimates to corroborate this range, which Bercy considers to be overestimated.
FR_009	19	The Cour des Comptes, commissioned by Matignon to produce a consensus figure, will submit a report on the subject in early November.
FR_013	1	Club pro des Vals de Saintonge supports local entrepreneurs
FR_013	2	"""A good forty people were present,"" says Chairman Fabrice Dayron."
FR_013	3	Membership fluctuates between 60 and 70.
FR_013	4	"Five new members joined the club in 2022: Vanloisir in Coivert, the Méchain flour mill in Courcelles, the fishmonger in Saint-Jean-d'Angély, the Clos Pallacien estate in Paillé and Atrium Data in Saint-Jean-d'Angély. ""It's interesting because these new arrivals are companies of all sizes and in all fields,"" enthuses Fabrice Dayron."
FR_013	5	Job day.
FR_013	6	The association's common thread?
FR_013	7	"""The aim is to encourage discussion and reflection on the sector's economy... in a convivial setting,"" sums up Fabrice Dayron."
FR_013	8	The association's governance remains unchanged.
FR_013	9	The only departure was that of Marie-Claude Mondain (Saint-Jean-d'Angély and Aulnay self-checkout), which was offset by the arrival of Marie Berger (manager of the Jean et Lisette cookie factory in Saint-Jean-d'Angély).
FR_013	10	The club's year was marked by a health crisis.
FR_013	11	Some of the Club pro's initiatives have been a success (company visits, matinales or lunchtime meetings), others not (English courses for company directors and executives).
FR_013	12	"The next initiative of the Club pro des Vals de Saintonge will be a major one. ""Together with Pôle emploi and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, we are organizing an employment day on May 18 at the Eden in Saint-Jean-d'Angély,"" announces Fabrice Dayron."
FR_013	13	"According to the Chairman, ""all companies are finding it hard to recruit at the moment, and we hope this action will help them""."
FR_013	14	Numerous employers in the Vals de Saintonge have already signed up, and will be offering part-time or full-time jobs on fixed-term or permanent contracts.
FR_013	15	Disability and employment.
FR_013	16	"The association will shortly be continuing its distribution of portraits of business leaders on social networks. ""One of our members, Jean-Pierre Fallou, is very active in building relationships with high schools and colleges, in particular to help young people find work placements,"" enthuses Fabrice Dayron, who works in close collaboration with his vice-president, Gaëlle Moynet-Popinot."
FR_013	17	The next corporate visit to Atrium Data's IT resource center is likely to attract many executives seeking information on new technologies.
FR_013	18	In the longer term, next November, Fabrice Dayron would like to organize, with all the business leaders' clubs, a big evening on the theme of disability and employment.
FR_019	1	Real estate.
FR_019	2	How will the market fare in 2022?
FR_019	3	If 2021 was the year of all records, 2022 marks a turnaround in the market.
FR_019	4	Transactions, which were still flourishing in the first half of 2022, recording double-digit growth compared to the previous six months, slowed down during the summer, according to the Century 21 real estate network, which is drawing up its assessment of the past year. 2022: the real estate market took a turn for the worse in the summer.
FR_019	5	Why did the market slow down last summer?
FR_019	6	The cause is a combination of several factors: the rapid rise in lending rates, which have more than doubled in the space of a year, from an average of 1.06% in November 2021, and the notorious usury rate, which was adjusted late, automatically disqualifying certain loan applications.
FR_019	7	Within the Century 21 network, the number of compromises cancelled on the grounds of loan refusal rose from an average of 3.2% in the first half of 2022 to 6% in the second half of 2022.
FR_019	8	Added to this was a worrying international context, triggering an energy crisis and with it a sharp rise in inflation in France from 2.9% in January to 6.2% at the end of November.
FR_019	9	Decline in home sales.
FR_019	10	Overall, real estate activity for the year was down 4.1% for Century 21, the result of a very marked slowdown in the house market (-8.2%), which is undoubtedly returning to normal after the post-Covid years when houses were particularly sought-after, stresses the network.
FR_019	11	Prices have continued to rise.
FR_019	12	In 2022, prices continued the upward trend that began in 2015, with the average price per additional m&sup2; of houses rising by 7.1%, while that of apartments increased by 4%, to €2,619 and €4,288 per additional m&sup2; respectively.
FR_019	13	Century 21 points out that these are historic records.
FR_019	14	However, these averages conceal month-to-month fluctuations, showing that prices peaked in the summer and began to fall in the second half of the year.
FR_019	15	Contrary to the national trend, Paris has seen its prices fall by 2.4% in 2022 compared to 2021.
FR_019	16	The decline began in June and, for the first time in a long time, the average price per m&sup2; fell below the symbolic €10,000 threshold in September, observes the network.
FR_019	17	For 2022, it now stands at €10,339 per sq. m.
FR_019	18	And what will 2023 be like for the real estate market?
FR_019	19	"We're emerging from a period of abundance to embrace greater moderation, but the appeal of stone is still tenacious in the hearts of the French,"" asserts Charles Marinakis, President of Century 21 France."
FR_019	20	The year 2023 should not mark a market collapse, but a necessary price adjustment, at least in certain départements.
FR_020	1	Airship plant at Laruscade: public consultation to reassure local residents
FR_020	2	"This consultation was carried out in workshops on the theme of ""environment and living environment""."
FR_020	3	"Beforehand, the effects of the activities on the environment were clarified by the speakers: ""compensation measures will be ecologically equivalent to biodiversity losses""."
FR_020	4	Road capacity would be sufficient to handle the traffic generated by the site, with the creation of a roundabout on the RD 250 for access by heavy goods vehicles (full capacity, ten trucks per working day).
FR_020	5	Local public transport will be strengthened, and the Communauté de communes Latitude Nord Gironde (CCLNG) plans to draw up a bicycle scheme in conjunction with the PLUi.
FR_020	6	"In terms of noise, the airship's assembly and production activities will have little effect: ""in the test phase, the source of noise will come from airship propulsion (ground and flight testing)""."
FR_020	7	Estimates were presented to the public.
FR_020	8	Then, in groups, participants answered questions relating to the advantages, disadvantages, assets and constraints of the project.
FR_020	9	Concerns.
FR_020	10	"A local resident whose house is located on the right-of-way wondered how he would access his home. ""To preserve usage, the project involves rerouting the road from another forestry track connected to the RD 250,"" replied CCLNG Chairman Eric Happert."
FR_020	11	"Local residents listed a number of disadvantages: ""loss of quality of life, noise, odors, light pollution and depreciation of nearby real estate"". No,"" replied one participant, ""the living environment will change and property prices will rise as the area becomes more attractive."

FR_026	1	A huge fault in the Antarctic ice has just opened up a new and devastating passageway
FR_026	2	The separation of what is expected to be one of the largest icebergs ever recorded is becoming increasingly imminent, following the enlargement of a fault some 180 kilometers long in Antarctica.
FR_026	3	Scientists have watched this massive crack in the Larsen Reef grow slowly for decades.
FR_026	4	The Larsen Ice Barrier actually consists of a series of three barriers that occupy (or used to occupy) distinct bays along the coast: from north to south, the three segments are called Larsen A (the smallest), Larsen B and Larsen C (the largest).
FR_026	5	"Unfortunately, over the past year, a series of rapid fault developments have seen the fracture split into two different paths, with a new secondary branch advancing 15 kilometers in the space of a few days. ""While the tip of the previous crack has not advanced, a new branch of the fault has been initiated,"" explains glaciologist Adrian Luckman of Swansea University, UK."
FR_026	6	With this new fault line, only some 20 kilometers of surface remain, holding back a 5000-square-kilometer chunk of ice...
FR_026	7	If (or more likely, when) this piece were to break off, it would be the third largest loss of Antarctic ice in history, ever recorded.
FR_026	8	"""This is the first significant change to the flaw, since February of this year,"" explains Luckman."
FR_026	9	"""Although the length of the fault has been static for several months, it has widened considerably and at rates exceeding one meter per day...,"" he adds."
FR_026	10	"While the main branch of the fault seemed to have slowed down, it abruptly increased by 10 kilometers last January, in the space of just 3 weeks, adding to the dramatic 18-kilometer advance in December 2016. ""You look at these cracks and you think they're moving really, really slowly."
FR_026	11	But when they expand, things happen very quickly.
FR_026	12	"Apparently, they can sometimes progress as fast as sound,"" explains Luckman."
FR_026	13	Over the past year alone, the crack has grown to cover some 60 kilometers.
FR_026	14	Researchers believe that the fault has now entered a region of wet ice, called a suture zone (which is the line marking the separation of originally distant spaces and representing a vanished intermediate space).
FR_026	15	Scientists believe that this part of the ice shelf slowed the progress of the fault, but at the same time contributed to the division of the crack into two separate paths.
FR_026	16	"Because the crack tip was in this zone of essentially softer ice, which is harder to fracture, then the stresses were transferred elsewhere,"" explains Luckman. ""The ice fractured in a region more vulnerable to fracture, which is about 10 km farther away than the current crack tip,"" he adds."
FR_026	17	At present, the severity of the situation has yet to be precisely defined, and the consequences of the fault's development on the ice shelf as a whole remain a mystery.
FR_026	18	Scientists studying the crack believe it is only a matter of time before the phenomenon permanently separates the 5,000 square kilometers from the rest of the Antarctic ice.
FR_026	19	And when that happens, Luckman (who had previously predicted that such a calving event would occur in just a few months), says the effects on the rest of the Larsen Barrier Ice Shelf could be catastrophic.
FR_027	1	The stodgy thinking of the European Union
FR_027	2	The European Union flag was waved a lot during the presidential campaign.
FR_027	3	Yet official thinking on the European Union is of a rare indigence.
FR_027	4	As if frozen, unable to evolve and adapt to geopolitical and economic changes.
FR_027	5	"Like a mantra, everyone repeats over and over that ""the Franco-German couple"" must remain the alpha and omega of France's European policy."
FR_027	6	What was obvious in the Common Market of six is less so in a Europe of twenty-seven.
FR_027	7	After successive enlargements, the hypnotic fascination with the other side of the Rhine became absurd.
FR_027	8	Ana de Palacio, Aznar's foreign minister, had proposed a Mediterranean alliance that would have brought together Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and France, a Latin nation linking southern and northern Europe.
FR_027	9	No use.
FR_027	10	The deal ends up with the UK and without France!
FR_027	11	The liberation of Eastern Europe opened up new opportunities.
FR_027	12	The countries of the Visegrad group, with a population of sixty-four million and great potential for economic development, could have been a balancing factor against Germany.
FR_027	13	"What's more, the experience of COMECON and its ""international socialist division of labor"" could be useful in countering the excesses of an increasingly bureaucratic European Union, which practices the ""international capitalist division of labor"" with relish."
FR_027	14	No new path was explored, as if France had fossilized an increasingly unbalanced relationship, since the fundamentals of the German economy are infinitely healthier than those of the French (German trade surplus 173.3 billion euros, French trade deficit 84.7 billion euros; German public debt 69.40% of GDP, French public debt 112.9% of GDP; German compulsory taxes 41.7% of GDP, French compulsory taxes 47.5% of GDP; share of industry in German GDP 23%, share of industry in French GDP 11.7%).
FR_027	15	The Franco-German partnership was based on a kind of balance between a Germany that was economically strong but politically dwarfed, and a France that was militarily strong thanks to its deterrent force and diplomatically strong thanks to its permanent seat on the UN Security Council.
FR_027	16	Germany is rearming, American nuclear weapons are on its territory, and Euro-fanatics are calling for France to give up its UN seat in favor of the European Union.
FR_027	17	The terms of the initial contract are modified.
FR_027	18	"Hence the urgent need to reinvent our European policy, all the more so as Germany is acting on its own with little regard for its partner: abandoning nuclear power without consultation, ""willkommen"" for the Middle East without further consultation, purchase of American F-35s rather than Rafales, which says a lot about Europe's pseudo defense policy."
FR_027	19	But beyond the worn-out relationship, France is showing a strange subservience to the Brussels machinery.
FR_027	20	Its sovereignty, i.e. its freedom, vanishes.
FR_027	21	No more monetary sovereignty, 60% of the texts discussed in Parliament are simply the introduction of European directives into our law, the budget controlled in Brussels, climate and energy policy under surveillance, fisheries policy determined at the Berlaymont.
FR_027	22	We could multiply the examples, all of which result in an impressive output of technocratic reports.
FR_027	23	Worse still, France supports the Commission in its desire to interfere in the internal affairs of member states.
FR_027	24	If need be, by exceeding the powers granted by the treaties.
FR_027	25	"Or even by challenging the democratic choices of the people in the name of an ad hoc ""rule of law""."
FR_027	26	So what could be more legitimate than to wish to rethink a Union, which no longer even calls itself European, in order to rediscover its original fundamentals, those of cooperation between European nation states with a view to shared and protected economic prosperity and common projects.
FR_027	27	"Not the monstrous construction of a constraining legal, technocratic and ideological whole, far removed from any flesh-and-blood roots and a mere ""prefecture"" of a world government."
FR_027	28	Apparently, for the ruling caste, any question about the EU is a crime against the European spirit, a perfidious desire to destroy the edifice.
FR_027	29	On the contrary, this passivity, submission and conformism are the best way to ruin it.
FR_027	30	"But since Rome, we've known that ""Jupiter drives mad those he wants to lose""."

FR_031	10	Police have confirmed that they received a call to Lake Beach Park at around 10:00 a.m., following reports of a large fight.
FR_031	11	Two men, injured during the fight, were arrested after returning to the scene with weapons, police said, without specifying what type of weapons they were.
FR_031	12	Later, anti-confinement activists, who were holding a beach party as an extension of their protest, claimed that the men with chainsaws assaulted them.
FR_031	13	Members of the MAD (Mothers Against Distancing) group claim that the two men wielding chainsaws destroyed over $4,000 worth of DJ equipment set up on the beach.
FR_031	14	"These guys fell on the beach after the party, after all the guests had left, except for a few people who were cleaning the beach,"" said Chris Sky, a well-known anti-mask campaigner."

FR_034	1	Vaccination: like a new Dreyfus affair, it tears families apart between pro and anti...

FR_034	9	"We ask ourselves the question: ""When do you get vaccinated?"
FR_034	10	"""Without a quick response, the tone becomes more urgent: ""But you're going to do it, aren't you?"
FR_034	11	"""As time went by and the pretext of age no longer applied, the sorting out began: ""We'll see you when you're vaccinated""."
FR_034	12	Good, then we may never see each other again... It's interesting to listen to the motives.
FR_034	13	"For example, this gentleman, vaccinated in the early days of Astra-Zeneca, explained to me the other day that he absolutely wanted to go to Bali this summer, which was why he had been bitten, and railed against ""those assholes who refuse""."

FR_034	17	"Once again, of course, there's no room for nuance, and refusing to accept vaccines that have been made in haste and for which we have no hindsight is equated with obscurantism...

FR_036	1	Infrared glasses connected to an armband to help blind people find their bearings
FR_036	2	Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (Germany) have designed an innovative device to help blind people find their way around and become more independent.
FR_036	3	The aim is also to enable them to move around faster and more safely, without the need for bulky systems.
FR_036	4	The device consists of a pair of infrared glasses connected to an armband fitted with vibrating pads.
FR_036	5	"The set of pads forms a highly simplified ""map"" of the space perceived by infrared cameras, enabling us to ""see"" a simplified version of the environment, as it were, without any perceivable processing latency."
FR_036	6	The major advantage of this technology, as well as providing a simple way of improving orientation, is that it requires no bulky equipment (unlike existing vibrating canes, for example).
FR_036	7	The details have been published on the arXiv preprint server An optimized layout for drive-free use.
FR_036	8	To design their system, the team of German researchers, consisting of Manuel Zahn and Armaghan Ahmad Khan, both from the Technical University of Munich, first placed two infrared cameras and an electronic processing device in a 3D-printed prototype mount.
FR_036	9	The prototyping flexibility offered by 3D printing enabled them to quickly obtain a viable provisional support.
FR_036	10	"To make the captured images usable by a blind person, they developed an algorithm that converts the global input (stereoscopic for depth perception) into a simplified ""image"" divided into 5 x 5 squares."
FR_036	11	These 25 squares of information are then transmitted to some extent to the 25 vibrating pads on a special cuff they have also developed.
FR_036	12	The electronic processing latency is imperceptible to the user, enabling him to perceive a simplified version of his environment, obstacles and potential hazards in real time.
FR_036	13	Overview of the results of the mapping algorithm in a corridor.
FR_036	14	As this image shows, users feel stronger vibrations where the elements are closer to them.
FR_036	15	The most distant elements do not cause any vibration.
FR_036	16	"The pads were arranged to reflect a ""logical"" dispersion of the visual information squares."
FR_036	17	For example, ankle-level ground at a certain distance is incorporated into the I-shaped diagram, which generally incorporates distant elements (as shown in the image above), as they more rarely constitute a direct hazard.
FR_036	18	The same applies to the ceiling or walls at the same distance.
FR_036	19	This intelligent arrangement makes it possible to provide optimized support with a small number of inputs (25).
FR_036	20	Some smart canes offer the same kind of safety advantage, but occupy at least one of the user's hands.
FR_036	21	Other, less cumbersome devices require the use of headphones, which reduces the wearer's auditory responsiveness.
FR_036	22	The system meets an obvious need, and is intuitive to use, according to researchers and early adopters.
FR_036	23	Conclusive preliminary tests.
FR_036	24	The researchers tested their device on five volunteers.
FR_036	25	On an indoor course, they were all able to complete their route on their first attempt, even though they had never used the device before.
FR_036	26	The average time taken to complete the course fell as the weekly tests progressed, from 320 seconds on the first attempt to 148 seconds two weeks later (third attempt).
FR_036	27	The only point to be criticized here is the fact that the same course was used each time, which despite the one-week difference adds a certain bias linked to the candidate's memorization.
FR_036	28	According to the researchers, the real design challenge was the cuff, which had to be large enough for the wearer to distinguish the vibrating pads and interpret the information without being too painful to wear.
FR_036	29	They plan to produce a more aesthetic and comfortable version of the glasses.
FR_036	30	The rest of the device can be fully integrated into an extendable cuff that can be worn discreetly under clothing.
FR_036	31	In short, this technology offers an innovative and discreet way of giving blind people greater independence and control over their environment, while making their movements safer than with some other aids on the market.
FR_036	32	"It could even be used in parallel with a standard white cane, undoubtedly providing a greater sense of security for the wearer while retaining the ""white cane visual alert"" for people interacting with it."

FR_054	11	The LR President makes no distinction between Marine le Pen and Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who want to deconstruct the European Union, and the President of the Republic, who shows the same blindness to the impasse in which Europe finds itself.
FR_054	12	He asserts: Emmanuel Macron has made no progress on the European stage; none of the ideas of the Sorbonne speech have been translated into action.
FR_054	13	"France has rarely been so isolated, and the icy reception from the podium is just another symptom of this,"" continues the President of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region."
FR_054	14	For his part, the French head of state is preparing to launch an internet platform for European citizens, which he has named Renaissance .

FR_063	1	Migrants: understanding the crisis at the Polish-Belarusian border
FR_063	2	The influx of migrants at the border between Poland and Belarus has provoked a diplomatic crisis between the two countries and concern in Europe.
FR_063	3	Here are five questions to help you understand this complex situation.
FR_063	4	What's the situation on the ground? along the 400-kilometer border between Belarus and Poland, including over 2,000 in a makeshift camp opposite the Polish village of Kuznica.
FR_063	5	These people, including children and women, live in difficult conditions.
FR_063	6	At night, temperatures drop below zero degrees Celsius.
FR_063	7	According to the Polish authorities, on Tuesday and Wednesday groups tried to force their way across the border at several points.
FR_063	8	At least ten people have died in recent weeks, seven of them on Polish soil, according to the daily Gazeta Wyborcza.
FR_063	9	Where do migrants come from?
FR_063	10	These are mainly people who have fled conflict or misery in the Middle East or Africa.
FR_063	11	Many of them are Kurds from northern Iraq.
FR_063	12	Over the past three months, 1,600 people have travelled to Belarus on tourist visas from Iraqi Kurdistan, according to the Kurdistan Refugee Association.
FR_063	13	People from Syria, a country at war for ten years, are also present at the border.
FR_063	14	A Polish woman helping migrants on site also said she had seen people from Yemen, Côte d'Ivoire and even Cuba.
FR_063	15	Why is the EU accusing Belarus?
FR_063	16	Brussels accuses Belarus's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating this migration crisis in revenge for Western sanctions imposed on his regime for the brutal repression of demonstrations last year.
FR_063	17	Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist since 1994, refutes these accusations.
FR_063	18	Lukashenko is accused of playing on Europe's fear of a massive influx of migrants, which has been keenly felt since the summer 2015 crisis when several hundred thousand people reached Greece from neighboring Turkey.
FR_063	19	In early 2020, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also played on this fear by allowing tens of thousands of migrants to cross the border into Greece.
FR_063	20	How is Poland reacting?
FR_063	21	"Faced with the influx of migrants, Warsaw denounced an ""attack"" by Minsk, beefed up its presence at the border, deploying some 15,000 troops, and decided to build a wall."
FR_063	22	Poland has also imposed a state of emergency in the border area and authorized its security forces to turn back migrants.
FR_063	23	One of the questions raised concerns cooperation between Poland and the European Union, whose relations are very strained, with Brussels concerned about the state of the rule of law in this member country.
FR_063	24	On Wednesday, European Council President Charles Michel travelled to Warsaw for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
FR_063	25	Russia, solution or problem?
FR_063	26	Russia, Belarus' main supporter, has remained relatively discreet until now.
FR_063	27	Aware of Moscow's influence on Minsk, the EU and Germany on Wednesday called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to intervene to end the crisis.
FR_063	28	Weakened by Western sanctions, Lukashenko's regime is heavily dependent on Russian financial and politico-military support.
FR_063	29	But Putin, who has been trying for several months to get Berlin to open up a new gas pipeline, is turning a deaf ear for the time being, merely calling for dialogue.
FR_063	30	Moscow has also called on Europe to provide financial assistance to Minsk to take care of the migrants.
FR_074	1	Health pass soon mandatory for weddings
FR_074	2	To attend a wedding at a venue rented for the occasion, you'll need to show your health pass.
FR_074	3	The measure is due to come into force on August 9, once the law has been enacted.
FR_074	4	In addition to the invitation, you'll now need a health pass to attend a wedding.
FR_074	5	The measure, included in the bill to extend the health pass, is due to come into force on August 9, if the this Thursday.
FR_074	6	Specifically, guests will need to show their health pass if the ceremony takes place in a venue rented for the occasion.
FR_074	7	However, the sanitary pass will not be required for access to private premises such as a family home.
FR_074	8	"""From the moment you rent an establishment, whether it's a château, a restaurant or a reception hall, the sanitary pass will be required"", explains Mélissa Humbert-Ferrand, President of the Union des Professionnels Solidaires de L'Evénementiel (UPSE)."
FR_074	9	But who will control it?
FR_074	10	"""By default, for rented establishments, it will be up to the bride and groom to take care of the sanitary pass control,"" assures the UPSE president."
FR_074	11	The law could allow the bride and groom to negotiate with the manager to have him check the sanitary pass at the entrance to his establishment.
FR_074	12	"""This can be included in the rental contract,"" says Mélissa Humbert-Ferrand."
FR_074	13	In this way, managers ensure that receipts are properly checked, and the bride and groom don't have to take on the role of steward.
FR_074	14	As with restaurants and cultural venues open to the public, they will not be responsible for checking the identity of the holder of the health pass.
FR_074	15	A tedious process for future brides and grooms.
FR_074	16	Controlling your own guest passes requires a great deal of organization.
FR_074	17	Officially, private individuals are not authorized to use the TousAntiCovid Verif application to scan the QR codes on sanitary passes.
FR_074	18	Even if, in practice, the application does not require users to prove that they are authorized to use it, by virtue of a July 19 decree.
FR_074	19	"""We encourage brides and grooms to plan ahead and ask for the credentials of each guest before the ceremony, so that on the big day there are only last-minute tests to check,"" explains the UPSE president."
FR_074	20	"She confirms that some future brides and grooms had already been demanding the health pass from their guests for several weeks to ""reassure themselves""."
FR_074	21	The measure is generally well accepted.
FR_074	22	"""People understand that a pass is required for an exceptional event that brings together a large number of guests."
FR_074	23	"It doesn't provoke the same reticence as the introduction of the health pass in everyday life"", assures Mélissa Humbert-Ferrand."
FR_076	1	Virus: soaring cases of contamination in Israel, new restrictions
FR_076	2	New health restrictions came into force on Wednesday in Israel, which has recorded its highest number of contaminations since January despite a large-scale anti-vaccination campaign.
FR_076	3	The Hebrew state has reinstated the requirement to show a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test to visit restaurants, hotels, museums and libraries, and to attend cultural and sporting events.
FR_076	4	This measure also applies to places of worship accommodating more than 50 worshippers, the Ministry of Health said in a statement, adding that seating capacity in stores and shopping centers is now limited to one person per seven square meters.
FR_076	5	Starting in July, the Hebrew state reinstated certain measures that had been lifted in June, such as the obligation to wear a mask in enclosed public places and offices, against the backdrop of a rise in the number of sick people.
FR_076	6	On Tuesday, more than 8,700 new patients were registered by the health authorities, the highest figure since January.
FR_076	7	In June, only a few daily cases were detected.
FR_076	8	Israel was one of the first countries to launch a large-scale vaccination campaign in mid-December, thanks to an agreement with Pfizer, which rapidly delivered millions of paid doses in exchange for data on the effect and efficacy of the vaccine on its population.
FR_076	9	This campaign had drastically reduced the number of cases, but in recent weeks the number of contaminations has risen again, with the spread of the Delta variant among unvaccinated adults, and also among people vaccinated more than six months ago.
FR_076	10	Last week, the Hebrew state began injecting a third dose of the vaccine into people aged 50 and over, despite a call from the World Health Organization (WHO) for a moratorium on these booster doses in order to leave more vaccine available for poor countries, where vaccination rates remain low.
FR_076	11	Prime Minister Naftali Bennett retorted that the administration of these booster doses in Israel, a country of nine million inhabitants, would not affect global stocks, but rather allow the effectiveness of the 3rd dose to be tested.
FR_076	12	Mr. Bennett warned that a new lockdown could be imposed in September, the month in which several Jewish holidays are celebrated, if the situation does not improve.
FR_076	13	In all, over 950,000 people have been infected in Israel, of whom almost 6,700 have died.
FR_076	14	More than 5.4 million people have received two doses of vaccine, and some 1.1 million a third dose.
FR_079	1	Controversy over PE during the Olympic Games: Jean-Michel Blanquer responds to Evan Fournier
FR_079	2	"""Thanks to the momentum of the Olympic Games, we're going to take a new step in favor of school sports."""
FR_079	3	This is what the Minister of National Education, Jean-Michel Blanquer , had meant, he explains.
FR_079	4	"His link between the success of indoor team sports at the last Olympics (five medals, including three golds) and ""the quality of teaching of these sports in schools"" earned him the mockery of several sportsmen and women, and an opinion piece from basketball player Evan Fournier."
FR_079	5	"In particular, it asked him to ""take advantage of the Paris 2024 wave to reform sport in schools""."
FR_079	6	"""Did I mean to say that the situation was perfect and that we had won these medals thanks to physical education and sport?"
FR_079	7	"No,"" defends Blanquer, who assures us that he will soon be meeting several athletes, including Fournier ""if he so wishes""."
FR_079	8	Here is the full answer given by Jean-Michel Blanquer.
FR_079	9	"Following France's Olympic medals in team sports, several athletes criticized you for your comments on ""the quality of teaching of these sports in schools""."
FR_079	10	"In particular, basketball player Evan Fournier is asking you to ""take advantage of the Paris 2024 wave to reform sport in schools""."
FR_079	11	What's your answer?
FR_079	12	I say yes!
FR_079	13	Did I mean to say that the situation was perfect and that we had won these medals thanks to physical education and sport [EPS]?
FR_079	14	No.
FR_079	15	On the other hand, I wanted to thank the PE teachers for their work and point out that some sportsmen and women have found their vocation at school, as Martin Fourcade reminded us.
FR_079	16	I build bridges, not walls, between PE and sports clubs.
FR_079	17	Evan Fournier's opinion converges with what I wanted to say: thanks to the momentum of the Olympic Games, we're going to take a new step in favor of sport in schools.
FR_079	18	That's what we've started to do by rolling out the Pass'Sport, creating the Génération 2024 label, the 30 minutes of daily physical activity, adapting certain vocational baccalaureate specialties to the sports professions, multiplying sports sections... It's a good debate that will enable us to move forward, because the sporting culture is not strong enough in France.
FR_079	19	"Evan Fournier used the expression ""outstretched hand"": he meets another outstretched hand, which is mine."
FR_079	20	In fact, I'm going to be meeting some athletes - Evan Fournier if he's willing and able - to talk about it.
FR_079	21	With Roxana Maracineanu, Tony Estanguet and Brigitte Henriques, we will soon be meeting with athletes and heads of federations.
FR_079	22	We all have the same goal: more sport in our society, and it starts at school!
FR_086	1	RESEARCH Nantes-based biotech Valneva in the race for a vaccine against Covid-19 If research is successful, VLA2001 should enter the clinical phase at the end of the year, and be available by mid-2021.
FR_086	2	Could a vaccine against Covid-19 be found in Nantes, far from the world's major research centers?
FR_086	3	At least, that's what biotech Valneva, based in western France, is working on.
FR_086	4	The company employs over 500 people worldwide, but it is in the Nantes suburb of Saint-Herblain that it is developing its vaccine: VLA2001.
FR_086	5	"A ""very stressful"" job In the company's highly secure laboratory, a technician delicately handles flasks containing the coronavirus. ""When we received the virus, we began to realize that we were working on something very important, but also very stressful"", recalls Fabien Perugi, Head of Preclinical Research for France at Valneva."
FR_086	6	Its researchers drew on their knowledge of inactivated virus technology, a process which creates an immune response in patients by injecting them with a virus stripped of its ability to cause harm.
FR_086	7	The Nantes-based biotech company has already marketed vaccines against Japanese encephalitis and cholera.
FR_086	8	This was enough to convince the British authorities, who recently placed pre-orders for at least 60 million doses of a potential Covid vaccine.
FR_086	9	Some 160 vaccines under development.
FR_086	10	But for Valneva, the competition is going to be tough.
FR_086	11	According to the World Health Organization, 160 vaccines are currently under development, 23 of which have entered human clinical trials.
FR_086	12	Above all, with sales of 130 million euros in 2019, the biotech does not have the striking capacity of a behemoth like Sanofi (36 billion euros in sales last year).
FR_086	13	However, Franck Grimaud, the company's General Manager, believes that the company, with its knowledge of vaccines, has a role to play.
FR_086	14	Attempting to develop a vaccine is not without risk for a small organization.
FR_086	15	"This represents an investment of between 150 and 300 million euros, according to Franck Grimaud. ""From the outset, we've been working at our own costs and taking our own risks, without knowing if it's going to work,"" he explains."
FR_086	16	"However, ""we can't enter the clinical phase without 100% support""."
FR_086	17	It is therefore vital for Valneva to sign agreements with governments, who share the financial risks and in return ensure access to the vaccine if it works.
FR_086	18	In this context, collaborations are multiplying.
FR_086	19	After the British, the company plans to cooperate with the European Union.
FR_086	20	The need for several vaccines.
FR_086	21	VLA2001 is due to enter the clinical phase at the end of the year, and should be available by mid-2021.
FR_086	22	Slightly later than the timetable posted by other laboratories.
FR_086	23	"But it will be necessary to have several vaccines,"" says Valneva's CEO, ""because the number of doses required worldwide will be so large."
FR_086	24	Not all projects will succeed, he points out, as some technologies used by competitors have never been proven in a vaccine.
FR_087	1	Sanofi acquires US biotech Translate Bio, specialist in messenger RNA
FR_087	2	Although Sanofi is still lagging behind in the race for vaccines against Covid-19 , the French pharmaceutical group is still keen to demonstrate its interest in messenger RNA technology.
FR_087	3	This is a genuine innovation used in vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna laboratories in particular, and has since proved its effectiveness.
FR_087	4	On Tuesday August 3, the French giant announced the acquisition of US biotech Translate Bio, itself a specialist in messenger RNA-based therapies and vaccines, for $3.2 billion (around 2.7 billion euros).
FR_087	5	Sanofi will acquire all outstanding shares of Translate Bio at a price of $38 per share, representing a cash transaction valued at approximately $3.2 billion (on a fully diluted basis), the French group said in a press release.
FR_087	6	Sanofi and Translate Bio have already been collaborating since 2018.
FR_087	7	The two companies have entered into an exclusive collaboration and licensing agreement, and two clinical trials of messenger RNA vaccines (one against Covid-19, the other against seasonal influenza) are underway.
FR_087	8	Interim results from phase III clinical trials of the Covid vaccine are expected in the third quarter.
FR_087	9	Unlocking the potential of mRNA.
FR_087	10	With this transaction, Sanofi will acquire Translate Bio's pipeline, which includes compounds in early development for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and other rare lung diseases.
FR_087	11	Its therapeutic mRNA (TRM) platform could be used to develop antibodies or vaccines in various therapeutic fields.
FR_087	12	Our goal is to unleash the potential of mRNA in other strategic areas, such as immunology, oncology and rare diseases, in addition to vaccines , observed Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson, quoted in the release.
FR_087	13	The deal, unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of 2021, and Sanofi intends to finance it with its available cash.
FR_087	14	On June 29, Sanofi announced that it was investing around 400 million euros a year in a center of excellence dedicated to messenger RNA vaccines, the first of its kind.
FR_087	15	The aim is to accelerate the development and supply of these vaccines for routine use against infectious diseases.
FR_094	1	"Oil: ""We can't replace the Russians"" (United Arab Emirates)"
FR_094	2	"For the UAE Energy Minister, increasing production by OPEC oil-exporting countries is ""difficult""."
FR_094	3	The organization and its allies, including Russia, are due to meet on Thursday.
FR_094	4	For the time being, they have refused to significantly increase their production to relieve the market, contenting themselves with supplying an additional 400,000 barrels per day during the month of March.
FR_094	5	For the time being, OPEC+ members are refusing to increase their production significantly to relieve the market, sticking to the gradual increase of 400,000 barrels per day each month agreed at the beginning of February.
FR_094	6	At a time when Western countries are urging the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase production in order to curb the surge in crude prices, the Emirati minister found it difficult to do so.
FR_094	7	The reason given: the fact that some member countries are facing a decline in production, due to lower investment in the oil sector.
FR_094	8	Speaking at the Atlantic Council's World Energy Forum in Dubai on Monday March 28, the UAE's Minister of Energy, Suhail al-Mazrouei, ironized the position of Western countries.
FR_094	9	At COP 26 (on climate change), all the producer countries felt unwelcome (...)
FR_094	10	Today, because they want us to increase our production, we're back to being superheroes.
FR_094	11	"But it doesn't work like that,"" he declared."
FR_094	12	Lire aussi 4 mn Suhail al-Mazrouei also indicated that the alliance forged by OPEC with other major producer countries including Russia, forming OPEC+ since 2016, is here to stay .
FR_094	13	"Unless someone is prepared to supply 10 million barrels a day, there's no replacing the Russians in the market,"" continued Suhail al-Mazrouei."
FR_094	14	He asserted that the Gulf countries were determined not to let politics undermine the organization.
FR_094	15	OPEC and its allies are due to meet on Thursday March 31.
FR_094	16	In other words, for the time being, OPEC+ members are refusing to significantly increase their production to relieve the market, sticking to the gradual increase of 400,000 barrels per day each month decided at the beginning of February.
FR_094	17	And this despite the recent surge in crude oil prices.
FR_094	18	Read also 3 mn The Minister called for long-term investment in the sector and a more sensible approach to the energy transition.
FR_094	19	He also warned of the impact of the war in Ukraine on the prices of all raw materials, not just energy, calling for a diplomatic settlement to the conflict.
FR_094	20	Oil demand dependent on war in Ukraine.
FR_094	21	In mid-March, OPEC announced that oil demand in 2022 would depend on the consequences of the war in Ukraine and higher prices, raising the possibility of a future downward revision of its forecasts for this year.
FR_094	22	In its monthly report, OPEC nevertheless maintained its estimate of an increase in global demand of 4.15 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022.
FR_094	23	But the organization stressed that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and concerns about COVID-19 would have a negative short-term impact on global growth.
FR_094	24	Read also 4 mn In the future, the challenges facing the global economy, including slowing growth, rising inflation and ongoing geopolitical unrest, will have an impact on oil demand in various regions , she says.
FR_094	25	While the year began on a relatively solid footing, the latest events in Eastern Europe could derail the recovery, explains the report.
FR_094	26	Opec maintains its forecast for world oil consumption of over 100 million bpd in the third quarter, and raises its annual forecast by around 100,000 bpd to 100.90 million bpd.
FR_094	27	The report also indicates that OPEC production in February reached 28.47 million bpd, thanks to increased supply from Saudi Arabia and Libya.
FR_106	1	Robert Castel, or the art of laughing at one's own misfortune
FR_106	2	The death of actor Robert Castel marks the end of a certain kind of cinema, the cinema of the pieds-noirs, a cinema that the under-fifties knew little or nothing about.
FR_106	3	And yet, in its own way, this rather unusual genre was one of the great successes of our big screens in the remote days of Giscardo-Mitterrandism.
FR_106	4	"On hearing of his death, Enrico Macias, another leading light of the day, said: ""I've lost a brother."
FR_106	5	"He was like a brother in every way. [...] It was he who guided me in acting, because I'm a singer first and foremost."" Indeed, Robert Castel, Robert Moyal by his real name, comes from a musical background."
FR_106	6	Her father, Lili Labassi on stage, is one of the masters of chaabi, Judeo-Arabic music with an Andalusian background, later supplanted by raï and then rap, as the Maghreb no more escaped the American onslaught than we did.
FR_106	7	As for our national Enrico, his father was a violinist in the orchestra of Cheick Raymond, his future father-in-law and, incidentally, an expert in malouf, the Tunisian variant of Algerian chaabi.
FR_106	8	No one has waited for today's armchair anti-racism to remind us that French identity can also be the result of contributions as varied as they are exotic.
FR_106	9	In 1957, Robert Castel's La famille Hernandez, a play based on improvisation techniques, long before Jamel Debbouze, was a big hit in the French music hall.
FR_106	10	Once again, Paris is not averse to adopting cultures from the margins of its fading empire.
FR_106	11	And yet, in 1962, it was a turning point: for the French of France and Algeria.
FR_106	12	Hundreds of thousands of the latter join, more or less forced - more than less, in fact - the mother country, exporting their roots with them.
FR_106	13	It was on this occasion that Robert Castel's career really took off, forever embodying the emblematic figure of the pied-noir, with his truculence and loquaciousness.
FR_106	14	In short, this is the role of a lifetime for him.
FR_106	15	Blessing or curse: he won't, or never will, be able to get out of it.
FR_106	16	Some would argue that anything is better than unemployment for an actor, and that some, surely more talented than he, would have loved to be locked away in such a gilded closet for all eternity.
FR_106	17	From then on, he worked in a series of mostly minor roles, alternating between top-of-the-range films (Dupont Lajoie , by Yves Boisset, in 1974) and those of a less demanding kind (Arrête ton char... bidasse !
FR_106	18	by Michel Gérard, in 1977), with his unmistakable accent and his eternally bewildered face.
FR_106	19	All this coincides with the heyday of the aforementioned pied-noir cinema.
FR_106	20	Its relative high points include Alexandre Arcady's 1978 film Le Grand Pardon, the pied-noir equivalent of Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, with Roger Hanin as Marlon Brando.
FR_106	21	But also with its abysses, as witnessed by Rodriguez au pays des merguez , by Philippe Clair (Prosper Bensoussan, in civil status), who died on November 20.
FR_106	22	Shot in 1979, this commendable but not entirely convincing attempt transposed Corneille's Le Cid to post-war Bab El Oued.
FR_106	23	Needless to say, the result continues to delight deviant film buffs.
FR_106	24	Nevertheless, one lingering feeling remains from this eminently popular cinema: that of a certain restraint.
FR_106	25	The ashes of the tragedy of the exodus are still hot, but there's no resentment or rancor.
FR_106	26	As if the best way to put an end to misfortune were to laugh about it, following the example of Gérard Oury and his Grande Vadrouille , filmed twenty years after the Occupation.
FR_106	27	Grief had its elegance back then.
FR_106	28	Like the late Robert Castel, who, throughout his long career, was always more inclined to poilade than jérémiade.
FR_106	29	An example to ponder today?
FR_118	1	"Comics: ""Peau d'homme"", Grand prix de la critique 2021"
FR_118	2	"The Association des journalistes et critiques de bande dessinée has awarded its Grand Prix to the magnificent ""Peau d'homme"", by Hubert and Zanzim, published by Glénat."
FR_118	3	The title won the RTL prize, the Landerneau prize and the Wolinski prize.
FR_118	4	"After a third round of voting, the Association des Critiques et Journalistes de Bande Dessinée (ACBD), which brings together professionals from a wide range of media, including ""Sud Ouest"", has crowned ""Peau d'homme"" by Zanzim and Hubert, published , with its Grand Prix 2021."
FR_118	5	What if, during the Renaissance, a woman could literally slip into a man's skin, to fully experience life as a man?
FR_118	6	In Peau d'homme, scriptwriter Hubert (recently deceased) and illustrator Zanzim craft a clever, modern tale that plays on clichés and cleverly resonates with our century.
FR_118	7	Fluid, the adventure is sometimes light, sometimes deep, and benefits from a supple, elegant and highly legible line.
FR_118	8	Together, the authors have already penned Les Yeux verts (ed.
FR_118	9	Carabas), La Sirène des pompiers (ed.
FR_118	10	Dargaud), and Ma vie posthume (ed.
FR_118	11	Glénat).

FR_118	13	"It was one of the favorites of ""Sud Ouest Dimanche"" on June 28."
FR_118	14	"""This is one of Hubert's most beautiful texts, a sensitive and committed author."
FR_118	15	Poetic but uncompromising, it questions questions of gender and sexual orientation, between impulses, social determinism and religious dictates.
FR_118	16	"Designer Zanzim has made this story his own, with the ""very clever false naiveté"" that gives it a special flavor."
FR_118	17	A sunny but posthumous jewel.
FR_118	18	"Hubert passed away last February, aged 49."""

FR_118	22	The other four finalists were: ● Anaïs Nin: Sur la mer des mensonges, by Léonie Bischoff, éditions Casterman ● Carbone & Silicium, by Mathieu Bablet, éditions Ankama ● Longue vie, by Stanislas Moussé, éditions Le Tripode ● Un travail comme un autre, by Alex W.
FR_118	23	Inker, Sarbacane editions.
FR_118	24	The aim of the ACBD prizes is to support and highlight, in a spirit of discovery, comic books published in French, with high narrative and graphic standards, and which stand out for their power, originality, the novelty of their subject matter or the means used by the authors.
FR_123	1	Peng Shuai affair: should the Beijing Games be boycotted politically?
FR_123	2	After the bogus e-mail, the suspicious photos.
FR_123	3	On Friday evening, photos of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai were posted on the Twitter account of the editor-in-chief of China's state-affiliated Global Times newspaper.
FR_123	4	The 35-year-old is seen cuddling her cat amidst cuddly toys.
FR_123	5	"The accompanying message states that she is at home and will be making a public appearance ""soon""."
FR_123	6	On Saturday night, wearing a navy blue sports jacket and white sweatpants, Peng Shuai appeared in photos from the Fila Kids Junior Tennis Challenger Finals, posted on the China Open's official Weibo account.
FR_123	7	This is his first public appearance since his accusations of sexual abuse were widely censored on the Chinese internet.
FR_123	8	The same Global Times reporter tweeted another video showing Peng signing autographs for children in what appears to be the same stadium before posing for photos with them.
FR_123	9	AFP was unable to confirm the location or the conditions in which the images were shot.
FR_123	10	And no reference is made to the Weibo account in Chinese.
FR_123	11	In some images, Peng Shuai is surrounded by two women with whom she shares a meal and wine in a noisy setting.
FR_123	12	"A man sits opposite the player and the conversation turns to ""matches""."
FR_123	13	"""Tomorrow is November 20"" (Saturday), he says, before being interrupted by one of the guests: ""It's the 21st"" (tomorrow, Sunday)."
FR_123	14	The exchange, which appears to have been staged, was filmed on a cell phone by an unidentified person during the evening.
FR_123	15	Peng Shuai appears relaxed.
FR_123	16	"Thomas Bach spoke during a ""thirty-minute"" videoconference on Sunday with Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, the Olympic body announced in a press release."
FR_123	17	"The Olympic Committee said she ""explained that she was safe and sound at home in Beijing, but would like her privacy respected"", during the call, which was also attended by Athletes' Commission President Emma Terho, and Olympic Committee member Li Lingwei from China."
FR_123	18	It had been three weeks since the former French Open doubles winner had last given any personal news.
FR_123	19	Her disappearance is linked to the accusations of sexual assault she made earlier this month against former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli.
FR_123	20	The UN calls for proof of life.
FR_123	21	"France and the United States expressed their ""concern""."
FR_123	22	The affair comes at a bad time for the Communist regime, which will be hosting the Winter Olympics in three months' time.
FR_123	23	It has revived calls for a boycott of the event, made by NGOs denouncing human rights abuses in China and in particular the persecution of the Muslim Uighur minority.
FR_123	24	"On Thursday, Joe Biden said he was ""considering"" a diplomatic boycott."
FR_123	25	Will his European counterparts follow suit?
FR_123	26	So far, none have ventured into this territory.
FR_123	27	Only the British and European parliaments have called on politicians to refuse any participation in the opening or closing ceremonies.
FR_123	28	"In Paris, it is felt that this kind of event should not be ""instrumentalized"" and that ""if we have things to say to the Chinese on human rights, we should do so publicly or through diplomatic channels""."
FR_123	29	But even if there is a boycott, it remains to be seen how effective it will be.
FR_123	30	"If it's to satisfy Western public opinion or ease our conscience, why not,"" says Antoine Bondaz, a researcher at the Fondation pour la recherche stratégique."
FR_123	31	"But this will have a very limited impact in China and won't change the attitude of the authorities."""
FR_123	32	The Asia specialist argues that this could even prove counter-productive.
FR_123	33	"""The regime and the Party will denounce the American attitude and play the nationalism card to emerge stronger."""
FR_143	1	Why Macron is making resolving the crisis in Lebanon a French affair
FR_143	2	"""Because it's you, because it's us,"" exclaimed Emmanuel Macron on August 6, 2020 in Beirut."
FR_143	3	At the time, the French President had interrupted his vacation at Brégançon to visit the battered people of Beirut, two days after the double explosion that devastated the city.
FR_143	4	A year later, the French president will host a third conference in support of the country of the Cedars from his summer residence.
FR_143	5	A small nation of just 6.7 million inhabitants, Lebanon is very much a French affair.
FR_143	6	Two of the people who have the ear of the head of state were ambassadors there.
FR_143	7	Diplomat Bernard Émié, current head of the DGSE, was head of the Ras El-Nabaa chancellery at the time of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri's assassination in 2005.
FR_143	8	The President's diplomatic adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, set up shop in the same embassy in 2015 before returning to serve in Paris after Macron's election.
FR_143	9	"The Head of State is also aware of the Lebanese issue through his ""Senghor"" classmate at ENA and Lebanon's ambassador to Paris, Rami Adwan."
FR_143	10	Lebanon is a geostrategic observation post for studying the Middle East's upheavals.
FR_143	11	Paris has numerous agents in Lebanon, supports the Lebanese Armed Forces and mobilizes 700 blue helmets to protect the south of the country as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
FR_143	12	The French presidents celebrate a shared history, one that began in the days of the Crusades.
FR_143	13	France, the country's Mandatory Power from 1920 to 1943, helped shape a multi-faith state, in particular to protect Maronite Christians.
FR_143	14	This system worked for several decades, but led to clientelism and elite prebend.
FR_143	15	The parties don't want to implement reforms in order to preserve their clientelist policies.
FR_143	16	Neo-colonial attitude.
FR_143	17	France still maintains a high level of cultural and linguistic cooperation.
FR_143	18	It funds many schools.
FR_143	19	Nearly 40% of the Lebanese population speaks French.
FR_143	20	"More than 200,000 Lebanese live in France, and 25,000 French were resident in the Land of the Cedars before the health crisis. ""Our destinies are inextricably linked by the ties of time, spirit, soul, culture and dreams,"" said Emmanuel Macron in 2020."
FR_143	21	"Paris clings to its ""Cedar"" like an oyster to its rock."
FR_143	22	Its officials display a neo-colonial attitude, supported by a section of the population that loathes its own leaders.
FR_143	23	The Elysée is currently playing a game of carrot (aid) and stick (sanctions) to get this political class to break the deadlock and finally form a government capable of taking action against the economic and social crisis.
FR_143	24	Lebanon is a case of successive bankruptcies.
FR_143	25	The Taëf Agreement, designed to put an end to the civil war in 1989, took away prerogatives from the Christians and gave them to the Muslims, without resolving the power struggle between the different communities.
FR_143	26	"The parties are unwilling to implement reforms in order to preserve their clientelist policies.

FR_176	1	G20 Finance notes failure of OECD tax reform negotiations
FR_176	2	On Wednesday, the G20 finance ministers confirmed the failure of political negotiations around the OECD-led project for international taxation of digital activities.
FR_176	3	"In the run-up to the presidential election, the United States put the brakes on. ""It has been agreed that work will continue until mid-2021,"" said Bruno Le Maire after the meeting."
FR_176	4	"But Bercy no longer believes in it. ""There will be no agreement at the OECD in January, February, March or April."
FR_176	5	The best way to make progress is to have a European solution.
FR_176	6	"The Commission is due to present its own tax on digital services in early 2021,"" added the Finance Minister."
FR_176	7	And yet, according to the latest report from the Conseil des prélèvements obligatoires (CPO), submitted to the French National Assembly on Wednesday, a deal could have been worth a lot to France.
FR_176	8	The document assesses the financial consequences for France of the introduction of a tax on the digital activities of major multinationals, and of a worldwide minimum corporate tax.
FR_176	9	Three lessons were learned.
FR_176	10	Firstly, French companies pay much higher taxes than others.
FR_176	11	Production taxes and corporate income tax (IS) total 124 billion euros in revenue, and together account for 15.7% of all compulsory levies in France, compared with 12.9% in the European Union.
FR_176	12	Secondly, the OECD reform would be a clear winner for France's coffers.
FR_176	13	Not so much by taxing the digital activities of major corporations.
FR_176	14	According to the CPO, the resulting redistribution between companies' countries of origin (which take the whole pot today) and consumer markets, which demand their share, would result in a loss of revenue of between 300 and 400 million euros for French companies.
FR_176	15	This decline is offset by additional revenues from Google, Facebook and Amazon.
FR_176	16	But the report did not evaluate them.
FR_176	17	With the current French tax on digital services generating 400 to 500 million euros a year, the equation would be fairly neutral for public finances.
FR_176	18	The 3,748 pages of the French Tax Code are packed with rules, but also with exceptions.
FR_176	19	Although the nominal corporate income tax rate is 33.33%, 70% of beneficiary companies pay an average rate of less than 12.5% minimum tax.
FR_176	20	The introduction of a minimum corporate tax of around 12%, on the other hand, would yield much more.
FR_176	21	By siphoning off tax havens, this measure would bring in around a hundred billion euros worldwide, according to the OECD.
FR_176	22	France's share?
FR_176	23	"7.3 billion euros, says the CPO, ""including 3.9 billion paid by companies established in France and 3.4 billion by subsidiaries of foreign companies""."
FR_176	24	"However, ""these figures are highly sensitive to tax and accounting restatements"", warns a member of the CPO."
FR_176	25	France's tax system is like a huge Swiss cheese.
FR_176	26	The 3,748 pages of the French Tax Code are packed with rules, but also with exceptions.
FR_176	27	The notorious tax niches which mean that today, even though the nominal corporate income tax rate is 33.33%, 70% of beneficiary companies pay an average corporate income tax rate of less than 12.5%, thanks in particular to the carryover of losses from one year to the next.
FR_176	28	All in all, the average IS rate in France has been relatively stable since 2015, at around 21%.
FR_176	29	If international rules did not take these French specificities into account, the bill would be much higher for French companies.
FR_176	30	But whatever the outcome of the US election vote, the US is not about to return to the negotiating table.
FR_176	31	France will therefore demand payment of its tax on digital services in December and spring, after suspending it pending the outcome of negotiations at the OECD.
FR_176	32	At the risk of American customs retaliation.
FR_182	1	14:16 Environment Carrières-sous-Poissy: his town polluted with heavy metals, the mayor claims 80 million euros
FR_182	2	"More than 5 months after lodging a complaint against X for heavy metal pollution, the mayor of Carrières-sous-Poissy (78) Eddie Aït is renewing his demand for justice, and has filed a civil action to ""obtain compensation""."
FR_182	3	He is claiming 80 million euros for the damage suffered by his municipality.
FR_182	4	"""I'm counting on the courts to enforce the 'polluter pays' principle in this case,"" explained Eddie Aït, who has been elected to head Carrières-sous-Poissy since 2020, in a press release."
FR_182	5	His target is the polluter or polluters who have been discharging their polluted wastewater into Carrières-sous-Poissy for decades.
FR_182	6	According to the mayor, a total of over 330 hectares of land in his municipality have been contaminated by heavy metals such as lead, zinc, mercury and arsenic.
FR_182	7	Pending investigation.
FR_182	8	As the law allows him to do so more than 3 months after filing his first complaint in September, Eddie Aït - who is also president of the Progressive Ecologists group on the Ile-de-France regional council - now wants to go further.
FR_182	9	"A week ago, he lodged a ""complaint with a civil party"" with the senior examining magistrate at the Versailles judicial court."
FR_182	10	"""Now we can be sure that things will move forward,"" he explained on Thursday February 18, confident that the ""investigation"" carried out by the judge will make it possible ""to find the person or persons responsible for this endemic pollution, which has completely mortgaged the agricultural vocation of this plain, unbalanced the fauna and flora of our territory and endangered the lives of our inhabitants"". 80 million euros in damages."
FR_182	11	"It also hopes to ""obtain compensation for ecological damage"" and is claiming nearly 80 million euros."
FR_182	12	"According to his calculations, this substantial sum is intended to make up ""the shortfall in taxes"" that should have been paid to his municipality in respect of general taxes on polluting activities."
FR_182	13	"But also, to a lesser extent, the ""costs of containment and removal of polluted soil"", the ""costs of decontamination work"", the ""loss of property tax and council tax"" and ""moral prejudice"", estimated at... one symbolic euro."
FR_182	14	"And the damage is extensive, according to Eddie Aït, since - as he points out - the Carrières-sous-Poissy plain ""served as a giant sewer for the Paris conurbation for over a century""."
FR_182	15	"Worse still, ""the spreading of sludge from the Syndicat interdépartemental pour l'assainissement de l'agglomération parisienne (SIAAP) has resulted in lead concentrations in the soil ranging from 138.2 to 640 mg/kg, whereas the maximum concentration in the Ile-de-France region is 53.7 mg/kg"", he explains, pointing out that this pollution remained ""untreated until 1995"", then ""partially treated until 2006""."
FR_182	16	"This ""pollution is emblematic of what the greater Paris region no longer wants"", says the ecologist mayor, who stresses the need for his city - which has already been hard hit by pollution on several occasions, notably due to the presence of an open-air landfill nicknamed the Sea of Waste - ""to move forward on a positive and benevolent path"" and ""to move away from the status imposed for decades""."
FR_182	17	"He also sends a clear message to the public authorities: ""We no longer want to be a servant territory, where we collect the wastewater, garbage and rubble of a Greater Paris that has forgotten us, but a resource territory""."
FR_182	18	"""You can't ask us to fight urban sprawl, build housing, preserve natural spaces, organize public transport, boost local commerce and at the same time be the dustbin of the Ile-de-France,"" he concludes."
FR_185	1	"""We mustn't let the energy crisis break this reindustrialization momentum""."
FR_185	2	Founder of a textile brand made in Limoges (Belleville-manufacture) and president of the Origine France Garantie certification, entrepreneur Gilles Attaf believes that made in France has a future more than ever.
FR_185	3	Is it more attractive to produce in France today than it was a few years ago?
FR_185	4	Yes.
FR_185	5	The competitiveness gap with countries like China is narrowing.
FR_185	6	Transport costs are soaring and wages are rising in Asia.
FR_185	7	We can achieve a level of productivity that enables us to compete with our competitors at the other end of the world.
FR_185	8	Today, we have the capacity to manufacture mass-market products on French soil.
FR_185	9	Do you have any concrete examples?
FR_185	10	Industries that we had written off are back on the agenda: we reproduce denim or connected objects in France.
FR_185	11	Nothing is lost!
FR_185	12	For example, Innov 8 will manufacture a universal cell phone charger that can be recycled and repaired in France, making it as competitive as its Asian competitors!
FR_185	13	I'm also thinking of Lucibel, which closed an LED manufacturing plant in China and relocated it to Normandy.
FR_185	14	You are president of an association that certifies products made in France.
FR_185	15	Beyond access to the domestic market, what commercial interest could a manufacturer have in setting up a plant in France?
FR_185	16	The image, the intangible aspect of the France brand, works very well in the export market.
FR_185	17	For example, we have awarded the Origine France Garantie label to Toyota's Yaris Cross hybrid (editor's note: manufactured in Onnaing, Nord).
FR_185	18	They only sell part of this production in France.
FR_185	19	Most cars are exported to the rest of Europe.
FR_185	20	It's good for a company to say it produces in France, because it conveys a positive image of know-how.
FR_185	21	Despite our deindustrialization over the past forty years, producing in France has retained this image.
FR_185	22	We need to capitalize on this.
FR_185	23	France is the country that has lost industrial jobs most rapidly in recent decades.
FR_185	24	And yet, there is increasing talk of reindustrialization.
FR_185	25	Do you see industry returning to France?
FR_185	26	By 2021, there will be 120 additional plants in France.
FR_185	27	This is a net balance.
FR_185	28	This is a tremendous turnaround, as this balance has remained negative for many years.
FR_185	29	But we mustn't let the energy crisis we're going through derail this reindustrialization drive.
FR_185	30	Origine France Garantie members have seen their energy bills rise by 65% over one year.
FR_185	31	Some of them are seeing increases of 150%!
FR_185	32	You need to be able to see what your bills will be for the next few months.
FR_185	33	Next, we need to create a competitive shock for our industries, by offering them attractive, low-carbon energy.
FR_185	34	We often hear about jobs in short supply.
FR_185	35	Is the industry facing recruitment problems?
FR_185	36	Yes, because industrial training courses have been devalued.
FR_185	37	For years, when we talked about factories, we were talking about Zola: dirty, polluting... We need to restore the desire for factories.
FR_185	38	Today, it's a place where you can learn, where the social ladder works, and where you can plan your life.
FR_193	1	War in Ukraine.
FR_193	2	Live: further positive signs for Ukraine's EU bid
FR_193	3	Brussels is expected to recommend that Ukraine be granted EU candidate status.
FR_193	4	This Friday, the European Commission is expected to present a positive opinion on Ukraine's candidate status for EU membership.
FR_193	5	An exceptionally rapid procedure, which could augur well for the EU's decision next week.
FR_193	6	The 27 are due to decide next week whether or not to grant Ukraine this status.
FR_193	7	A decision that must be unanimous.
FR_193	8	On a visit to Kiev the day before, the leaders of France (Emmanuel Macron), Germany (Olaf Scholz) and Italy (Mario Draghi) declared themselves in favour of granting Kiev candidate status immediately, specifying that this status would be accompanied by a roadmap.
FR_193	9	And conditions.
FR_193	10	"Kiev is ready to work towards becoming a full member of the EU,"" replied Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky."
FR_193	11	"In Marioupol, ""horrors"" inflicted on the population."
FR_193	12	The horrors inflicted on the civilian population of the southeastern port of Mariupol, which fell under Russian control in May after a terrible siege, will leave an indelible mark, including on future generations, said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Thursday.
FR_193	13	Between February and the end of April, Marioupol was probably the deadliest place in Ukraine.
FR_193	14	"The intensity and extent of the fighting, the destruction, (the number of) dead and wounded strongly suggest that serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have taken place,"" she added, as evidence of war crimes committed in Ukraine mounts."
FR_193	15	Around 10,000 civilians are still present in Severodonetsk , a key city in the Donbass region which the Russians have been trying to seize for weeks.
FR_193	16	According to the regional governor, the Russian army is losing hundreds of fighters, but is finding reserves and continuing to destroy Severodonetsk. - There has been no overall assessment of civilian casualties in the conflict.
FR_193	17	In the southeastern city of Marioupol alone, which fell in May after a terrible siege, Ukrainian authorities had put the death toll at around 20,000. - In military terms, Western security sources now put the death toll at between 15,000 and 20,000 Russian soldiers.
FR_193	18	According to Kiev, Ukrainian forces are losing around 100 soldiers a day. - More than seven million Ukrainians are internally displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
FR_193	19	Another 7.4 million have fled abroad, more than half of them to Poland.
FR_193	20	Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and Mario Draghi were in Kiev on Thursday, having taken a train from Poland.
FR_193	21	They visited Irpin, a devastated suburb of the capital, joined by Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.
FR_193	22	On the spot, Emmanuel Macron praised the heroism of the Ukrainians.
FR_193	23	They then met with Volodymyr Zelensky in the early afternoon.
FR_193	24	At a press conference, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Romania announced that they wanted Ukraine to be granted official EU candidate status immediately.
FR_193	25	"Ukraine is ready to work towards full membership of the European Union,"" replied Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky."
FR_193	26	France is to supply Ukraine with six more Caesars than the 12 already delivered, self-propelled guns renowned for their precision.
FR_208	1	Europe: reopening of borders and difficult climate talks
FR_208	2	"""We need to strike a balance, because some countries want to reserve the right to impose national measures (on travelers) such as quarantines,"" observes one diplomat."
FR_208	3	The Twenty-Seven have also already agreed to allow entry into the EU for third-country travelers who have received the necessary doses of European-approved anti-Covid vaccines.
FR_208	4	"The composition of a list of countries deemed ""safe"", currently restricted to seven countries from which ""non-essential"" travel to the EU is authorized, will also be discussed, with no decision expected on Tuesday."
FR_208	5	The summit is also an opportunity for the leaders to discuss their positions on the future climate action plan to be proposed by the European Commission in mid-July, with a view to achieving carbon neutrality for the continent by 2050.
FR_208	6	Sharing the effort.
FR_208	7	The Twenty-Seven had agreed in December to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, but without addressing the ways of achieving this: they now want to provide the Commission with concrete guidelines for drawing up its proposals on the system for sharing emission reduction efforts between countries.
FR_208	8	This system includes sectors (transport, buildings, agriculture, waste management, etc.) currently excluded from the carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS), which is strictly reserved for energy and industry companies.
FR_208	9	The debate centres on the criteria for this distribution: should it be based on a country's GDP, when the most developed countries have already massively slashed their emissions and the least favoured countries, which are often the most polluting, lack the means to invest?
FR_208	10	"According to another diplomatic source, ""You can't manage a carbon price for road transport the same way you do for a factory [...] Some countries have started to do it, others are radically against it, others are questioning the solidarity of the system""."
FR_208	11	"Imposing emission rights or new restrictions on road and air transport, or on sea freight, ""these are highly sensitive issues and we can't have a written agreement on them before the Commission puts forward its proposals, it's too technical""."
FR_214	1	G7 in Biarritz: a total of 119 in police custody, some 50 prosecutions
FR_214	2	Between August 19 and 26, the G7 summit in Biarritz and the counter-summit gave rise to 119 police arrests, which have been or will be followed by around 50 legal proceedings, the Bayonne public prosecutor's office reported on Thursday.
FR_214	3	A total of 168 arrests were made before and during the heads of state summit, mainly in the towns of Bayonne, Urrugne and Hendaye, according to Bayonne public prosecutor Samuel Vuelta-Simon.
FR_214	4	"""The demonstrators were able to express themselves and there was no breakage or injury,"" he added."
FR_214	5	"Among the arrests, ""16 people were subject to deportation measures because they were banned from French territory, and others already had sentences to serve, applicable immediately"", he detailed."
FR_214	6	This was the case for three Germans, aged between 18 and 22, arrested during a roadside check in Biarritz and considered potentially dangerous.
FR_214	7	They were tried on Friday August 23 in an immediate court appearance in Bayonne, on the eve of the opening of the G7, and were sentenced to two to three months' imprisonment.
FR_214	8	Investigations still underway.
FR_214	9	"""Around fifty cases will be heard by the court until December"", added Samuel Vuelta-Simon. added Samuel Vuelta-Simon, including cases of ""participation in a group with a view to committing damage or violence"", ""violence and contempt of persons holding public authority"" and ""transporting and carrying a weapon""."
FR_214	10	Three investigations, entrusted to the Bayonne judicial police, are still underway, including one into the assault on two police officers and motorcyclists in Urrugne on Friday August 23, when they were attacked by a dozen radical demonstrators.
FR_214	11	"The two police officers are very shocked, although no major physical injuries have been reported,"" says Samuel Vuelta-Simon. 13,000 police officers were deployed."
FR_214	12	Six suspects were arrested and released.
FR_214	13	The investigation to identify the perpetrators of the violence is still underway.
FR_214	14	Meanwhile, a Landais couple arrested before the opening of the G7, suspected of defacing speed cameras and painting anti-G7, pro-Gilets jaunes and pro-blacks-blocs tags, will be tried on September 9 by the Dax correctional court.
FR_214	15	Just over 13,000 police and gendarmes were deployed for the summit, and fears of violence mobilized 17 prosecutors, 70 lawyers and 300 cell spaces every day.
FR_214	16	"On Thursday, the local Basque party EHBai denounced in a press release ""the disproportionate police and security measures deployed in the Basque Country for over a week"", pointing to a ""permanent state of siege"" and ""very strong repression""."
FR_227	1	Yes, we need to be concerned about Francophone overindebtedness.
FR_227	2	It didn't take a year for the Wallonia-Brussels Federation to sink into budgetary hell.
FR_227	3	In July 2020, its Budget Minister, Frédéric Daerden (PS), made some reassuring comments in our columns.
FR_227	4	To cope with the crisis, his government borrowed at the most advantageous rates, making the debt burden perfectly bearable.
FR_227	5	Even for an institution that has no fiscal leverage to finance itself.
FR_227	6	Tenable was the word.
FR_227	7	"Intenable is today's,"" admitted the socialist earlier this week."
FR_227	8	Weakened by its deficits, the former French Community is not viable in the long term, he believes.
FR_227	9	With a hole of 1 to 1.5 billion a year, the French-speaking debt should rise from 11 to 18 billion by 2026, according to (rounded) projections by the University of Namur.
FR_227	10	In five years' time, this debt will represent almost 150% of the Federation's revenues, compared with 93% today.
FR_227	11	And Frédéric Daerden calls for institutional reforms, as if to prepare public opinion for the four-region Belgium project that the PS is discreetly preparing.
FR_227	12	Will it rely on Wallonia?
FR_227	13	The region's budgetary situation is not exactly rosy either.
FR_227	14	Currently at 23 billion on a budget of 19, its debt could flirt with 40 billion by 2026.
FR_227	15	In addition to this crisis management situation, and in contrast to the federal level, neither government is displaying any real ambitions in terms of spending cuts.
FR_227	16	Wallonia is content to hope that its operating expenses will be balanced by the end of the legislature, while the Wallonia-Brussels Federation is satisfied with a more detailed assessment of its needs.
FR_227	17	The Liberals' return to power seems to have changed nothing.
FR_227	18	We end with the Brussels Region's deficit of around 2 billion - out of a budget of 4.5 billion - which should increase its debt from 11 to 19 billion by 2026.
FR_227	19	In the shadow of this picture, the danger is twofold.
FR_227	20	Who can say what effect the economic recovery will have on interest rates?
FR_227	21	The financing capacities of authorities carrying such large stocks of debt could suffer from even a small increase, while the European Commission, always keen on structural reforms and now a borrower, is likely to return to its fundamentals in terms of budgetary rigor.
FR_227	22	Secondly, just as the process leading to a reform of the state by 2024 has begun, the French-speakers already appear to be in a weakened position in the face of a prosperous Flanders, which is running up debts on a much more solid socio-economic foundation.
FR_227	23	Francophones have a good three years to put on a calmer face.
FR_239	1	Presidential election: with over 23% of the vote, Marine Le Pen achieves a historic score for her party
FR_239	2	For the third time in twenty years, after 2002 and 2017, a far-right candidate will be in the final of the presidential election.
FR_239	3	But never before has the Front National, which in 2018 became the Rassemblement National (RN), achieved such a high score in this election.
FR_239	4	Marine Le Pen won 23.3% of the vote in Sunday's first round of the presidential election, according to an Ifop estimate.
FR_239	5	A record broken after the 21.3% collected five years ago, and which should also be confirmed in terms of the number of votes: the frontiste won 7.67 million in 2017; this time, she should exceed 8 million.
FR_239	6	In 2002, against a backdrop of high abstention rates, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, received 4.8 million... For Marine Le Pen, this increase in five years is a taste of revenge, as the FN president emerged from the election politically weakened, with only 33.9% of the vote in the second round.
FR_239	7	The 2022 configuration is more favorable to him: the first second-round poll published on Sunday evening, carried out by Ifop, gives him 49% of voting intentions against 51% for Emmanuel Macron.
FR_239	8	Within the margin of error, which is plus or minus three points.
FR_239	9	The prospect of conquering power had never been so real...
FR_239	10	The only hitch for the MP for the Nord region was that, despite a fine rise in the polls towards the end of the campaign, Marine Le Pen was unable to challenge Emmanuel Macron for first place, which could have turned the political tide.
FR_239	11	Instead, it remains 5 points behind the outgoing President, who is doing better than expected (28.3% of the vote).
FR_239	12	The gap between the two finalists is even greater than five years ago (2.7 points, or around one million votes).
FR_239	13	To reach the Elysée, Marine Le Pen will first have to counter any Republican barrage against her: several other candidates - Yannick Jadot, Fabien Roussel - have called for the head of state to be chosen, while Valérie Pécresse has indicated that she will personally vote for Emmanuel Macron.
FR_239	14	Above all, it must try to capitalize on an anti-Macron vote.
FR_239	15	"On Sunday evening, Marine Le Pen called for the ""great changeover that [France] needs"" and for French voters ""from the right, the left, elsewhere, of all origins to join this great national and popular rally""."
FR_239	16	"She also directly invited ""all those who did not vote"" for Emmanuel Macron to ""join her"" invoking ""two opposing visions of the future"" that will face each other on April 24."

FR_M_027	1	A referendum is the only way for the people to put an end to this sad period of mass immigration imposed on the French.
FR_M_027	2	Stop immigration to preserve our identity
FR_M_027	3	In the 1970s, successive governments made political choices with dramatic consequences when it came to immigration.
FR_M_027	4	They replaced the founding idea of assimilation with the vague concept of integration, and opened the floodgates to immigration without ever asking the people for their opinion, even though this did not correspond to the country's needs or desires.
FR_M_027	5	Right and left alike have allowed this juxtaposition of communities to continue, instead of asserting the existence of a single national community.
FR_M_027	6	But the story isn't over yet.
FR_M_027	7	We'll put an end to this mess by instituting new, firmer and fairer rules as early as June 2022 with a major referendum on immigration: together, we'll put an end to this irrational policy that threatens the survival of our Nation.
FR_M_027	8	I say it loud and clear: our people have the right to continue to exist, our people have the right to protect their identity, our people have the right to regain total control over immigration policy.
FR_M_027	9	Our country has a great future ahead of it, and the French don't want to leave history behind and be replaced in the land of their ancestors.
FR_M_027	10	With my project, generations of French people will be able to continue to flourish, succeed and prosper in France.
FR_M_027	11	The time for denunciation and lament is over, and it's time to take action and propose solutions.
FR_M_027	12	All my proposals on immigration have but one aim, the noblest and most legitimate of all: to ensure that France remains France.
FR_M_027	13	I will stop migratory flows Abolish the right to family reunification and all automatic rights linked to family immigration Return to the original spirit of the right to asylum by limiting it to a hundred or so individuals each year (compared to nearly 140,000 today) and require that asylum applications be lodged outside national territory, in our consulates, to avoid the settlement of rejected applicants who never leave Select foreign students on merit, Introduce a mandatory 10,000-euro deposit to obtain a visa for foreigners from countries where the majority of illegal immigrants come from, in order to limit entry and finance any deportations Denounce bilateral agreements that facilitate immigration, in particular the 1968 Franco-Algerian agreement, to put an end to migratory privileges Create a border guard with military status to support the country's border police force
FR_M_027	14	So I propose a different approach.
FR_M_027	15	As soon as the presidential election is over, I'll be calling for the renegotiation of European immigration rules, to give states back control of their borders and the ability to determine their own migration policy.
FR_M_027	16	Without waiting for a revision of the treaties, which will take a long time, I will free our country from the shackles of Brussels in this vital area.
FR_M_027	17	But far from remaining a national solidarity service, Social Security is now open to the whole world.
FR_M_027	18	Its generosity encourages massive immigration that does not contribute to the country's wealth.
FR_M_027	19	On the one hand, 40 years of immigration and increasing insecurity threaten them on a daily basis.
FR_M_033	1	After years of meetings with hundreds of thousands of French people, after years of alerting them to the dangers of mass immigration and deregulated globalization, after years of analysis of the ills affecting them and years of work to propose concrete solutions, the project I'm presenting here has its roots in centuries of civilization.
FR_M_033	2	More than ever, I am proposing a reasonable way forward to ensure the legitimate protection of the French nation and to project our country into a future that we hope will be radiant.
FR_M_033	3	PRESERVE THE FRENCH PEOPLE FROM MIGRATORY SUBMERSION.
FR_M_033	4	Because it's the role of the State, but also because the vast majority of French people want it, our country must regain full control over immigration.
FR_M_033	5	Within six months of the presidential election, I will ask the French people to adopt a certain number of essential provisions by referendum, failing which the very future of France as a Nation will be compromised.
FR_M_033	6	The text of the bill is fully drafted, and was in fact the first public element of my campaign.
FR_M_033	7	It's based on two simple principles: it's up to the French people, and them alone, to determine the migration policy our country should follow; foreigners' residence in France is not a right, but must be subordinated to the sole satisfaction of France's interests.
FR_M_033	8	To put the first principle into practice, the referendum will amend a number of articles of our Constitution to incorporate the migration issue into our supreme text, but also to prevent supranational courts from forcing France to follow policies contrary to the will of the French people.
FR_M_033	9	For the concrete application of the second principle, I will propose to the French people in the referendum to ban all forms of settlement aimed at altering France's identity (notably through family reunification, which will become a rare exception).
FR_M_033	10	Similarly, I propose that illegal, criminal or delinquent aliens should be systematically and immediately deported.
FR_M_033	11	Similarly, foreigners who come to work will have to return home after a year's unemployment.
FR_M_033	12	In this respect, I believe it is essential to remove all legal obstacles to the deportation of foreign criminals and delinquents, as well as to the issuing of deportation orders by the courts.
FR_M_033	13	What's more, if a foreign state refuses to take back its nationals, it will experience a firmness that, for fifty years, no French leader before me has dared to resort to: money transfers from France to the country concerned will be blocked; no more visas will be issued to any of its nationals.
FR_M_033	14	This simple rule will enable us to re-establish France's authority in migration matters on the international stage without delay.
FR_M_033	15	Finally, the referendum will make it possible to set in constitutional stone the rules governing French nationality, the way in which it can be acquired or the serious cases in which it can be withdrawn, and the possibility of resorting to national priority, a principle that exists in a large number of countries, making it possible, for example, to reserve a certain number of social benefits for French nationals only, or to give them priority access to social housing.
FR_M_033	16	Finally, I will restore the right to asylum to its rightful application, so that it is no longer a channel for immigration but a fair means of protecting the persecuted.
FR_M_033	17	Thirdly, the migratory pressure faced by some overseas collectivities needs to be brought under control.
FR_M_033	18	This is particularly true in Mayotte, where nearly 75% of the population is of foreign origin.
FR_M_033	19	Of course, the provisions of the referendum on immigration will apply overseas.
FR_M_035	1	DEFEND OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY IN A DETERIORATING INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.
FR_M_035	2	The figures will also be made public during the campaign.
FR_M_035	3	As politics is first and foremost a question of choices and priorities, it is through savings that I will finance new spending, and through a reorientation of our economic model that I intend to clean up the public finances that have deteriorated sharply at the end of this five-year term.
FR_M_035	4	Today, our country is faced with a return to power politics in a context of general rearmament of nations.
FR_M_035	5	Everywhere, we are witnessing an increasingly uninhibited use of violence, coupled with growing contempt for international law.
FR_M_035	6	The policy of fait accompli has gradually become the norm.
FR_M_035	7	Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine proves this once again.
FR_M_035	8	To ensure that we can defend our interests on a global scale, we therefore have a duty to considerably improve our defense capabilities.
FR_M_035	9	The armies of all European Union member states have been downgraded: the only exception to this rule is France, which has a rapid intervention and projection capability.
FR_M_035	10	This observation dictates the duty of the head of the armed forces for the years to come.
FR_M_035	11	That's why, first and foremost, I want our country - the world's second-largest power by geography, due to the extent of its maritime domain, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and the holder of nuclear weapons - to measure up to its responsibilities and opt for a hands-free policy.
FR_M_035	12	This requires France to withdraw from NATO's integrated command, put an end to industrial cooperation with Germany in the field of armaments - to the detriment of our technological sovereignty and industrial interests, given our doctrinal and operational differences - and lay the foundations for closer cooperation with the UK in line with the Lancaster House agreements.
FR_M_035	13	Above all, I want the new agreements to focus on three strategic issues for France: the fight against Islamic terrorism, cybersecurity and space.
FR_M_035	14	Firstly, a significant financial effort, enabling us to reach a budget of around 55 billion euros by 2027, so that we can increase the size of our armed forces in terms of personnel, equipment and munitions.
FR_M_035	15	So that the availability of soldiers is also guaranteed, despite the European Court of Justice's ruling on the application of the Employment Directive to the military, which must be seen for what it is: contrary to the interests of the Nation.
FR_M_035	16	Secondly, the moral rearmament of the armed forces.
FR_M_035	17	Since 2017, too many humiliations have been inflicted on the military.
FR_M_035	18	My conviction is that the military state must be respected in all its forms, and its traditions maintained and popularized.
FR_M_035	19	Improved military conditions in terms of income, housing, care for the wounded and retraining.
FR_M_035	20	I also want the armed forces to participate fully in major national and strategic debates.
HE_001	1	The &quot;settlement&quot; in Asada Leviathan has begun.
HE_001	2	Residents evacuate
HE_001	3	The resettlement procedure is taking place after the Ministry of Environmental Protection informed us last night that &quot;Nobel Energy Company met all the environmental-professional conditions of the Ministry.
HE_001	4	This, following the advance notice given on Friday.
HE_001	5	Therefore, the resettlement in Asada Leviathan will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, in the early morning hours, as planned.&quot;
HE_001	6	The ministry&#39;s announcement also stated that &quot;there are no special instructions for the public on this day, and the impact on the air quality in the coastal area in front of the rig is expected to be low.
HE_001	7	There is no place or instructions for the evacuation of residents, and according to the opinion of all the experts, no risk to the public is expected during the resettlement.&quot;
HE_001	8	In addition, it was reported that the Minister of Environmental Protection, the director general of the ministry and other senior officials and staff will be present in the Carmel Coast settlements and the monitoring stations, and that the ministry&#39;s inspectors will be in Asada during the settlement.
HE_001	9	It was also noted that reports from the stations will be broadcast online on the union&#39;s website and in the control room - starting at 06:30 in the morning.
HE_001	10	&quot;We recommend the public to download the &#39;Air in the Environment&#39; application and be updated in real time with the results of the monitoring stations, which reflect the state of air quality in the area,&quot; it said.
HE_001	11	This morning, many users reported a malfunction in the &quot;Air in the Environment&quot; application, which should provide air quality measurement data throughout the country.
HE_001	12	The Ministry of Environmental Protection stated that they have dealt with the provider of the application to solve the problem.
HE_001	13	It was also reported that all the data can be found in real time at
HE_001	14	According to Noble Energy, it is expected that there will be a continuous release of gases during the 8 hours of the settlement, when a total of 76 kg of benzene will be emitted in the last three hours of the process.
HE_001	15	Experts warn that Nobel&#39;s model is not accurate - and in the opinion of Prof. David Brodai and Prof. Uri Dayan from the Hebrew University it is claimed that the values ​​are expected to be higher.
HE_001	16	On the other hand, the Ministry of Environmental Protection announced that even in the most extreme model that takes into account the direction of the wind - the impact on the coastal area is expected to be minimal.
HE_001	17	In the meantime, residents chose to temporarily move to another place on their own accord, fearing that the resettlement operation would harm their health.
HE_001	18	It is possible that this is a step that shows a loss of faith in the government ministries entrusted with the quality of the environment and safeguarding public health.
HE_001	19	One of them is Elad Shai (50) from Moshav Ein Ayala, a local activist against the rig, who announced that he will evacuate together with his wife and four children aged 10-18.
HE_001	20	&quot;We will move to the central area, there will be large amounts of benzene here and we are afraid.
HE_001	21	The things of the government ministries do not reassure me.
HE_001	22	They just put one more bezan for us in front of the house.
HE_001	23	We see that in Haifa there is excess morbidity - and we are afraid that it will happen here as well.
HE_001	24	We don&#39;t understand what is the gain in closing the coal mines and operating the gas rig in front of us.&quot;
HE_001	25	&quot;No risk to the public is expected during the resettlement&quot; four days ago, the Ministry of Environmental Protection allowed Noble Energy to publish a notice to the public regarding the date of the resettlement in Asda - even before they announced that they met all the environmental conditions.
HE_001	26	So they stated that &quot;there are no special instructions for the public on this day, the impact on the air quality in the coastal area in front of the rig will be minimal.
HE_001	27	There is no place or instructions for the evacuation of residents and according to the opinion of all the experts, no risk to the public is expected during the resettlement.&quot;
HE_001	28	The Ministry of Health said at the time that &quot;the amount of emissions that should be dispersed as a result of the running and routine operation of the Leviathan rig, is estimated according to the models of the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
HE_001	29	According to these estimates, it was found that there is no significant additional risk to public health during the run-in period in areas where there are population concentrations.
HE_001	30	The Ministry of Health will continue to monitor the donors all the time to make sure that public health is not harmed.&quot;
HE_001	31	Noble also said that the rig meets all the strictest conditions regarding environmental protection, and that all the official bodies have explicitly stated that there is no danger whatsoever from the activity.
HE_001	32	However, as mentioned, residents in the area think - and act - differently.
HE_006	1	If the left wants change, let it unite already
HE_006	2	Despite the slight recovery of the Labor Party in the polls, when it and Meretz are hustling around 15 seats together - it is difficult to remain optimistic about the chances of change in the upcoming election system.
HE_006	3	You can say &quot;it is what it is&quot;, you can recognize that the left is a minority and you can also try to make changes in the array of parties and affiliations.
HE_006	4	There are three days left until the closing date of the lists and despite this, nothing seems to be moving on the left, except for time.
HE_006	5	Avi Gabbay is happy and rightly so from the &quot;Labor Team&quot;.
HE_006	6	His party also switched to a team campaign, which in my opinion was necessary a long time ago, but it also will not lead to a change, at most to reducing damages.
HE_006	7	In the absence of an act that changes reality, the left camp will surely shrink in the upcoming elections.
HE_006	8	There is nothing to be alarmed by this, many times a breaking point becomes a starting point.
HE_006	9	The only question that needs to be asked is whether those who stand at the head of the camp and ask us to entrust them with our votes at the ballot box, have done enough to change a reality that appears from the sidelines as a chronicle of foreknown failure.
HE_006	10	Meretz and the work are on a melting glacier and all they can do is try and delay its complete disappearance.
HE_006	11	In moments when reality scrapes the bottom of the barrel, you can accept the judgment on the way to the metaphorical gallows and you can try to change.
HE_006	12	One of Labor&#39;s and Meretz&#39;s favorite mantras is that a lot of people hold their opinions but don&#39;t vote for them.
HE_006	13	Beyond the fact that this is a problematic approach, in many ways it causes both to try to solve the problem over and over again in the same way.
HE_006	14	To change reality you have to look at it as it is and not out of wishful thinking.
HE_006	15	You can continue the resuscitation attempts that are made along the entire center-left avenue and hope for the best, but reality has been proving otherwise for years.
HE_006	16	On the other hand, it is also possible to notice that there are quite a few topics common to the work, Meretz and Hadesh.
HE_006	17	Belief in universal and democratic values, the rule of law, the end of the occupation, civil equality and the separation of religion from the state - all of these constitute a common denominator broad enough to create a united camp.
HE_006	18	There is no doubt that these three parties do not see eye to eye in all areas, but this in itself is not a problem - large parties often contain a wide spectrum of opinions, it is the agreement on the common basis that connects them.
HE_006	19	You wrote &quot;here&quot; about the sad state of the left - skip.
HE_006	20	A connection between Labor, Meretz and Hadash is an answer to Netanyahu&#39;s factional policy.
HE_006	21	A democratic, sane camp, based on coexistence that must happen whether we like it or not, and will be able to stand up to whatever is on the other side - right, new right or canonist right.
HE_006	22	Benny Gantz is right, it&#39;s not a matter of right or left - it&#39;s a public matter, but that&#39;s not because there is no right and left, but because the struggle right now is much more basic than that, it&#39;s about democracy.
HE_006	23	A united camp that believes in coexistence, is not afraid to say the word &quot;occupation&quot;, does not flatter the crowd but rolls up its sleeves - this is an answer that can produce a transformation.
HE_006	24	A camp that presents a plan to deal with the challenges facing Israel in education, health, transportation and housing - this is the embodiment of hope.
HE_006	25	Anyone who is committed to such a change cannot reach February 21, the closing date of the lists, without at least trying to bring it about, all the more so if they want to bring us to the polls.
HE_006	26	Sometimes all it takes is just one initiative.
HE_006	27	In order to win in the existing dismal situation, whoever is at the head of the left has to do everything, even if it requires reinventing the game.
HE_008	1	Drama in the banking industry: the Competition Court approved the merger of Mizrahi Tefahot and Agud
HE_008	2	The Competition Court (formerly the Antitrust Court) approved the merger of Bank Mizrahi Tefahot with Bank Egod.
HE_008	3	This paved the way for the first major merger of the banking sector in years.
HE_008	4	The Competition Authority opposed the merger and claimed that it was an uncompetitive move for banks.
HE_008	5	About a year and a half ago, the Antitrust Authority disallowed the merger between the two banks - Acting Commissioner for Antitrust, Attorney Uri Schwartz, then announced his opposition to the merger.
HE_008	6	The Authority explained that the merger of Union Bank may harm the already little competition for private customers in the banking system.
HE_008	7	This is a great victory for the supervision of the banks led by Hadva Bar who unequivocally supported the merger and against the position of the competition authority.
HE_008	8	The court&#39;s decision was made possible after an in-depth discussion, without the external involvement of ministers.
HE_008	9	Agud is considered an inefficient bank that caused grief to the controlling owners, led by Shlomo Eliyahu, in terms of the inability to become more efficient and did not distribute dividends, and in fact hardly contributed to competition between banks.
HE_008	10	The court accepted the position of the competition authority that the merger could harm competition in the field of credit for diamonds.
HE_008	11	&quot;There is a basis for the determination of the Commissioner regarding a reasonable fear of harming competition in regards to credit in the diamond sector.
HE_008	12	No foundation has been laid regarding a pro-competitive effect of the merger, which may constitute an adequate counterweight to this injury,&quot; the court&#39;s decision reads.
HE_008	13	&quot;Under these circumstances, the matter must be returned to the appointed M.M., in order for it to be required to question whether the aforementioned concern can be alleviated by setting conditions,&quot; the ruling states.
HE_008	14	In other words, on the subject of the credit portfolio for the Diamond Association, the ball returns to Michal Halperin, who may condition the merger on the sale of the portfolio to a competitive entity.
HE_008	15	This is as it also did in the merger of Dexia and Discount.
HE_008	16	Then Halperin demanded to sell part of the Dexia portfolio which was eventually sold to Union Bank.
HE_008	17	Now Agod somewhat paradoxically merges with Mizrahi so that the Dexia portfolio is actually sold to Mizrahi Tefahot.
HE_008	18	From the court&#39;s decision: &quot;The definition of the market on which the analysis was based in the decision of the Commissioner MM raises substantial difficulties, and cannot stand.
HE_008	19	Examining the transitions between the banks, which formed a central pillar in the opposition to the merger, also raises difficulties, both on the conceptual level, and on the applied and methodological level.
HE_008	20	Considering the characteristics of Union Bank, its methods of operation, the difficulties it faces, including in the area of ​​efficiency, and the absence of a significant indication of the bank&#39;s influence on the other players in the market, there is no basis for stating that the bank&#39;s departure is expected to significantly harm competition.
HE_008	21	This conclusion also stands in the face of reforms in the banking industry, which are in various stages of formation.
HE_008	22	In view of all this, the position of the Commissioner, that the merger raises a reasonable fear of significant damage to competition, as far as the basket of banking services is concerned, cannot stand, according to the extensive infrastructure that was presented.&quot;
HE_008	23	In conclusion, the decision states that &quot;the result of all that has been said is that the appeals are accepted.
HE_008	24	The decision to oppose the merger is hereby annulled.
HE_008	25	The matter is returned to the appointed MP, in order for him to complete his decision, in accordance with paragraph 226 above
HE_010	1	This is how we will properly limit strikes in essential services
HE_010	2	The possibility of the shutdown of public transportation by its employees is an issue that has been handled in two ways by the developed countries: the efficient countries, such as the USA and Germany, have made the trains, buses, seaports and air centers relatively neutral from shutdown by the workers through legislation and enforcement.
HE_010	3	On the other hand, there are the inefficient countries, where as the importance of systems such as the railways, the ports within the economic environment increased, so did the power of the workers and the committees.
HE_010	4	Public transportation, including trains, is defined worldwide as &quot;critical national infrastructure&quot; (Critical National Infrastructure or CNI).
HE_010	5	As mentioned, public transportation is a critical infrastructure, similar to energy infrastructure, water of all kinds, air and sea ports.
HE_010	6	These are &quot;essential services&quot;.
HE_010	7	The employees who provide service based on these infrastructures are subject in some countries to a different legal framework in terms of employee rights and obligations.
HE_010	8	In other words, if your work is related to national infrastructures on which the economy and good order of the country rests, you cannot decide when to work and when to strike.
HE_010	9	The failure of France.
HE_010	10	In the USA, the Railway Labor Act prevents railway and aviation workers from striking.
HE_010	11	In Germany, public employees in general, including public transport, but also teachers and civil servant street cleaners, cannot strike since 2014.
HE_010	12	France is probably the most prominent and well-known example when it comes to the failed government struggle against workers.
HE_010	13	The railway workers have been waging public struggles while shutting down the railway system for decades.
HE_010	14	The struggles, short or long, became the terror of the French.
HE_010	15	In extensive shutdowns that took place in the mid-nineties, 0.2% of France&#39;s domestic product was shaved off that year (over $300 million in 1995 terms).
HE_010	16	Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was eventually able to pass legislation requiring train workers to give 48 hours notice before shutting down a train.
HE_010	17	The legislation was effective in its early years, but over time its power diminished and the railway workers violated the law several times in recent years and shut down the train without warning.
HE_010	18	Over the years, railway workers in France have recorded many achievements.
HE_010	19	reduce the damages.
HE_010	20	Israel is a small and dense country with economic concentration in specific centers in the center, in the north and in the south, which will become more and more dense over the years, a situation that will bring with it an increasing dependence on public transportation in general and trains in particular.
HE_010	21	This will also increase the dependence on the regular work of seaports and aviation.
HE_010	22	Downtime or irregular work of these systems has a major impact on the economy.
HE_010	23	Therefore, the laws regarding the ability of organized and individual workers to damage critical systems must be regulated as quickly as possible.
HE_010	24	The claim that the rights of the railway workers will be harmed if they cannot strike - is justified and correct.
HE_010	25	But, even in democracies older and bigger than Israel, they recognize this harm, but reduce the ability of these workers to control the fate of people, the economy and the good order.
HE_010	26	The harm to workers and their rights in these countries does not spill over into other areas, as claimed in Israel, and is acceptable in light of the alternative of harming millions of people and the economy, while using resources that belong to the state.
HE_010	27	The writer is a partner and head of the strategic consulting division at the consulting and accounting firm Baker Tilly.
HE_013	1	2019 elections: take seriously the survivors of the holocaust Adv. David Yadin
HE_013	2	As in every election period, the various parties and candidates sharpen their messages: security, affordable housing, a lost reform in the field of education or the foreign policy that is at the top of our happiness.
HE_013	3	In the great commotion there is one important population that has been completely neglected, even by the parties that present a social worldview: the survivors of the Holocaust.
HE_013	4	Even the politicians who speak highly of the issue, do not really promote significant aid, but at most very marginal and partial aid, which is relevant only to a small group of survivors.
HE_013	5	On the last International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) published up-to-date data on Holocaust survivors in Israel.
HE_013	6	The data shows that this is a population that is disappearing; About 212 thousand Holocaust survivors lived in Israel at the end of 2017, compared to about 221 thousand at the end of 2016.
HE_013	7	According to the forecasts, in 2020 the number of Holocaust survivors in Israel will decrease and reach approximately 167,000 people.
HE_013	8	We would expect that the survivors, who bravely survived terrible events, would be rewarded with the guarantee of their lives to live comfortably, or at least in comfort.
HE_013	9	The painful and infuriating reality is that the quality of life of the survivors is in constant decline, and according to estimates, about a third of them live below the poverty line.
HE_013	10	Aid to the Holocaust survivors in Israel is not organized, but is structured as a patchwork on top of a patchwork, which creates a cumbersome bureaucratic maze.
HE_013	11	As a result, many Holocaust survivors do not exhaust the set of rights they are entitled to by law, many of them fail to receive the assistance required to live a reasonable life, or they are required to fight the bureaucratic system for a long time, despairing and giving up.
HE_013	12	For example, Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel before October 1, 1953 and are not entitled to compensation from the German government, are entitled to benefits and services from the Authority for Holocaust Survivors according to the Nazi Persecution Disability Law.
HE_013	13	Those who arrived after 1.10.1953 are entitled to rewards and a monthly allowance by virtue of the &quot;Benefits Law&quot; according to extremely strict criteria.
HE_013	14	Those who are not entitled to this or that, can sometimes receive an allowance from the Section 2 Fund of the Claims Conference if they have been recognized as persecuted by the Nazis.
HE_013	15	Groups of Holocaust survivors who were not collectively recognized as persecuted by the Nazis even though they suffered from Nazi persecution, and are entitled to a relatively low annual benefit.
HE_013	16	In addition, there are entitlements to assistance in social services in the local authorities, discounts in payments to the state, benefits in housing and more.
HE_013	17	And these are examples only on the tip of the fork, in practice the bureaucracy is much more complicated and cumbersome.
HE_013	18	The rights of the spouses of the Holocaust survivors, who supported and helped the survivors all their lives, are also complicated.
HE_013	19	Until 2014, the rights of the spouses of deceased Holocaust survivors were limited, but simple.
HE_013	20	Some of the spouses were entitled to monthly benefits for a limited period of three years from the date of the survivor&#39;s death.
HE_013	21	In June 2014, a number of welcome changes were made at the initiative of the Minister of Finance at the time, Yair Lapid, and the Israeli government decided to increase aid to Holocaust survivors, and extended the entitlement to monthly benefits of NIS 2,000 for the survivors&#39; spouses from three years to the rest of their lives, provided that the survivor died after 1 in June 2011, and his partner will not marry another.
HE_013	22	This is of course a very partial and abbreviated list, since all the details, clauses, laws and agreements seem endless.
HE_013	23	The result of the many nuances is that many Holocaust survivors are unaware of their full rights.
HE_013	24	Even when they are aware on one level or another, their claim is not always accepted, and they are required to conduct a cumbersome legal procedure which makes it difficult for them to prove their eligibility.
HE_013	25	I am addressing all the candidates for the House of Representatives: the Holocaust survivors are getting fewer and fewer, it is very important that they pass the end of their days without struggles and without difficulties.
HE_013	26	The most effective way is not to add additional clauses and nuances, but to simplify rights, remove barriers and benefit the survivors.
HE_013	27	You can of course add more rights, but it is much more important to give them in an accessible, clear and simple way.
HE_013	28	That everyone who is entitled will know about their rights easily, and will not be forced to fight for this right, in the face of a harsh system and with little attention to their needs.
HE_013	29	It is possible that these elections are the last opportunity to help many Holocaust survivors, it is time to place Holocaust survivors at the top of the national priority list and allow them to grow old with dignity.
HE_015	1	What&#39;s new in European anti-Semitism?
HE_015	2	is nothing
HE_015	3	The attack on the Jewish woman in Helsingborg in southern Sweden once again raises the issue of dealing with anti-Semitic phenomena in Jewish communities around the world, an issue that has never dropped from the agenda.
HE_015	4	These days there is a meeting of the Conference of European Rabbis in Brussels discussing the situation of the communities.
HE_015	5	In the Arutz 7 diary, we spoke with Eliezer Noy, a &#39;Torah Mezion&#39; emissary in Germany who was present at the conference, about the complex confrontation.
HE_015	6	Already at the beginning of his remarks, Noy clarifies that even in the current conference there is no discussion and no discussion of new news and new directions of action beyond what has been up to now, &quot;The calls are always to come and demand that the heads of state take responsibility for the Jewish citizens like any other citizen, and if there are threats to special populations the governments You need to take care of preventing these incidents.&quot;
HE_015	7	In his words, Noy clarifies that despite the recent events that made headlines in the Jewish communities in Europe, there are no special manifestations of anti-Semitism, such as did not exist in the past.
HE_015	8	&quot;Anti-Semitism in Europe is not new.
HE_015	9	In London they hold a special event, as an act of beating for sin, to mark the burning of York Jews in 1190.
HE_015	10	Anti-Semitism in Europe did not start yesterday.
HE_015	11	It started even before the Nazis did what they did.
HE_015	12	There is no new wave of violence.&quot;
HE_015	13	&quot;I can say about myself that I am like someone who lives in Germany, I walk around most of the time without a hat on my head with a cap and feel safe.
HE_015	14	For six years the only calls to me are &#39;Shabbat Shalom&#39;.
HE_015	15	There were those who were excited to see Jews.
HE_015	16	I travel a lot and can say that in Germany the feeling of security is complete, in France there are places where I will go with a hat on my head, in Brussels I will also go with a hat, but this is not a change in the level of anti-Semitism.&quot;
HE_015	17	However, Noy points out that the main problem is in the political arena, where the Jews are &quot;between a rock and a hard place, between the right that denounces the Jews along with Islam, and the extreme left that uses the excuse of denouncing the State of Israel and thereby attacking the Jews as those who support the State of Israel.&quot;
HE_015	18	As for European legislation against Jewish elements such as circumcision and Jewish slaughter, Noy says that the excuses for this legislation are usually humanitarian reasons.
HE_015	19	He mentions that in Norway&#39;s law book from about 1920 it was written that kosher slaughter is prohibited, and this in order to encourage Jews to leave the country...
HE_015	20	In his estimation, there is no special attention to targeted legislation against the Jews, and the feeling is that the European fear is more than Islam, but there are movements that direct this fear to all minorities, including the Jews.
HE_015	21	We also asked Noi whether the entry of Jews into the European parliaments helps the situation of the Jews, or whether those elected are renouncing their ethnic affiliation and perhaps even such an election leads to a renewed wave of anti-Semitism and hatred.
HE_015	22	In Noy&#39;s opinion, the less the focus on the Jewishness of such elected officials, the more they will be able to act for the Jewish public behind them.
HE_015	23	&quot;The less we talk about their influence, the more they will be able to act.
HE_015	24	They are under a magnifying glass because of the fact that they are Jews and the more they are marked as a Jewish model, the more they are afraid to advance steps in favor of the Jews.
HE_015	25	The less media focus we put on them, the more positively they will be able to act for the Jewish people.&quot;
HE_021	1	The ticking bomb of the business world Dan Proper
HE_021	2	The extreme changes that have taken place in the world economy and business culture have led me to gloomy conclusions about the future of the capitalist economy and the business world.
HE_021	3	It is clear that a person&#39;s search for a reward for his labor, talent and efforts requires a capitalist and competitive economy, which makes the world flourish economically and progress socially.
HE_021	4	But this honey also has a sting, which may weaken the capitalist systems and even cause them to collapse.
HE_021	5	Strong competition empowers the able-bodied, while relegating the weaker to the economic and social margins - a situation that ended up fueling an uprising against the system and leading to the destruction of the economic structure.
HE_021	6	Some of the transformations taking place today in Western democracies accelerate these processes, and the destruction is intensified by pig capitalism.
HE_021	7	Only legislation will ensure proper behavior of companies.
HE_021	8	It is true that attempts have been made in recent years to rein in the porky fringes of capitalism, through advocacy and thanks to the agreement of economic organizations to take care not only of their profits but also of those around them.
HE_021	9	But unfortunately, today there is no non-governmental factor with the power to curb the greed inherent in man, which pushes and promotes capitalism without moral-human limits.
HE_021	10	The only way to neutralize evil capitalism is through laws and regulations, which will enforce rules of proper behavior on companies.
HE_021	11	Another result of that greed is that in the future it will also spell the fate of the large traded companies without a core of control.
HE_021	12	These are multiplying in the world&#39;s stock exchanges, and today most of the large companies belong to this category.
HE_021	13	The process that made them without a core of control is accelerated growth and constant raising of new capital - raising that diluted the holdings of the founders and major investors.
HE_021	14	The shares of these companies are currently distributed among multitudes of small investors, who have no influence on their actions, a phenomenon that stands out mainly among the American giants traded on Wall Street.
HE_021	15	Therefore, the ones who direct the policies of the companies and their actions are the managements.
HE_021	16	True, they have boards of directors, whose job it is to formulate policy and supervise its implementation.
HE_021	17	But as a result of the power of the managements, they are the ones who influence in a large part of the companies the selection of the directors and the appointment of the chairman, and therefore - actually control the company.
HE_021	18	The rotating CEOs are unfazed by the future destruction.
HE_021	19	At the same time, the practice of high capital compensation for managers developed - in shares and options every year - and the companies&#39; successes led to the introduction of similar compensation for directors as well.
HE_021	20	It is the dangerous identity of interests created between the management and the board of directors that pushes to increase the value of the stock in the short term, which of course directly affects the extent of the private property of the managers and directors.
HE_021	21	Increasing the value of the stock is done in several ways, including activities of the company whose purpose is to impress the public of investors in the stock market, and to improve the profit at the expense of operations that are more vital to it.
HE_021	22	The desire to increase profit is legitimate and vital, as long as it does not detract from the financial resources invested in research and development, in strengthening the brands, in the required organizational changes and in new ventures.
HE_021	23	But here we are talking, in fact, about steps that harm the company, since the increase in the value for the investor in the short term comes at the expense of the operations that are essential for the long term.
HE_021	24	This situation highlights the conflict of interests between the management and the board of directors, the holders of the shares and options, and the good of the company and its future.
HE_021	25	This is also the difference between a strategic investor, such as an investor with a core of control, and an investor who is all about increasing profit in the short term.
HE_021	26	And the CEOs - who are usually replaced after a few years - are really not bothered by the destructive long-term effect.
HE_021	27	A company with such a structure will become weaker and weaker, because in the absence of investments in R&amp;D and brands, and without new initiatives that require the injection of funds at the expense of the profit line, it will not be able to meet the challenges of competition in the future.
HE_021	28	The fate of such a company is to sink, while companies with a controlling nucleus or private ownership will conquer the future markets.
HE_025	1	The governor of Hong Kong was recorded saying: &quot;I would resign if I could, but China won&#39;t let me&quot;
HE_025	2	Hong Kong Governor Carrie Lam has been recorded saying she would resign if she could, but the authorities in Beijing are preventing her from doing so.
HE_025	3	In the leaked recording, Lam was heard explaining that she was &quot;very, very limited&quot; in her ability to respond to the ongoing protest in the Special Administrative Region since June.
HE_025	4	She said the things to a group of businessmen in a closed meeting, and later called a press conference in which she denied the things.
HE_025	5	&quot;The involvement as a governor in the creation of this protest is unforgivable.
HE_025	6	If I had the opportunity, the first thing I would do is to resign, after a deep apology,&quot; Lam can be heard in the recording with a trembling voice.
HE_025	7	&quot;I beg you to forgive me.&quot;
HE_025	8	Following the leak, Lam called a press conference today (Tuesday), in which she denied the statements without referring to the recording.
HE_025	9	&quot;I have never submitted a resignation to the Chinese government, and I have never considered that possibility,&quot; she said.
HE_025	10	&quot;The choice not to resign is my choice alone.
HE_025	11	I believe in my ability to solve this crisis.&quot;
HE_025	12	Lam&#39;s words are further proof that the response to the citizen protest is being steered by the authorities in Beijing.
HE_025	13	The protests continued yesterday as well and police fired tear gas against students who were protesting in one of the city&#39;s neighborhoods.
HE_025	14	In the leaked recording, Lam explains that she is limited in her ability to respond to the protest, which has grown to the point where it is challenging Beijing&#39;s sovereignty and its ability to control the city from a security perspective.
HE_025	15	&quot;The room for maneuver of a governor, who unfortunately has to serve two masters of the government and the people of Hong Kong is very, very limited,&quot; she said.
HE_025	16	Sources connected to the protest speculated that the government had ordered Lam to stop the demonstrations until October 1, when China&#39;s 70th Independence Day will be celebrated.
HE_025	17	Lam denied the allegations.
HE_025	18	&quot;I can assure you that Beijing did not set us a deadline.
HE_025	19	They are also aware that the demonstrations will continue,&quot; she said.
HE_025	20	&quot;They are ready to continue absorbing, at the moment there is no short-term solution.
HE_025	21	Hong Kong will suffer economically, but there is not much that can be done about it.&quot;
HE_025	22	The authorities began making arrangements for a &quot;modest but dignified&quot; independence celebration.
HE_025	23	Yesterday, thousands of students boycotted the opening of the school year, and demonstrated on the spot in various centers in the city.
HE_025	24	Thousands demonstrated at the city&#39;s university, wearing helmets, goggles and masks, the protest&#39;s unofficial uniforms that protect against tear gas used by local security forces.
HE_025	25	The students announced a two-week protest strike, and the high school students announced that they would strike school once a week, until the end of the entire protest.
HE_025	26	Zheng Shuang, a spokesman for China&#39;s foreign minister, said yesterday that the protesters &quot;completely violated their right to demonstrate freely.&quot;
HE_025	27	&quot;The protest exceeded its legal dimensions due to violent events,&quot; he said.
HE_025	28	More than a thousand people have been arrested since the beginning of the protest, including 159 protesters who were arrested over the weekend, including a 13-year-old boy.
HE_029	1	The reform of the recognition of parentage in proud families: &quot;only guaranteeing elections&quot;
HE_029	2	In the opinion of Orli Weiselberg-Zur, who filed a petition to the High Court demanding that the registration of the LGBT parents of a child be compared to the registration of heterosexual parents, and that she be registered as the mother of her common son with her partner Roit, this is &quot;another headline about pink revolutions in Israel&quot;.
HE_029	3	&quot;The committee&#39;s recommendations reek of election assurance, which comes from the same government that systematically and consistently opposes pro-LGBT and egalitarian policies,&quot; she wrote to the LGBT news website WDG, following the publication on Ynet.
HE_029	4	In her words she requested: &quot;No more supervision, no more requests in courts, no more discrimination at all, big or small.
HE_029	5	Let us register as parents like everyone else - without easing the conditions, but simply without conditions.&quot;
HE_029	6	Reot Nagar, a prominent activist in the gay community and manager of the field of religion and state at the &quot;Israeli Alliance&quot; organization, actually expressed her joy at the move and said that &quot;the proposed reform is an image of victory and the product of a proud community that takes significant steps to make its voice heard and to be a community that works together for equality and personal security &quot;.
HE_029	7	However, Nagar added that &quot;the community is no longer innocent and empty of promises.&quot;
HE_029	8	We want to see results.
HE_029	9	In addition, the reform is also an intermediate step to the desired state.
HE_029	10	We demand the same treatment as a heterosexual parent, we don&#39;t need relief, we just need to stop discriminating against us.
HE_029	11	It is not in the state&#39;s interest not to automatically register us and there is no issue of the child&#39;s welfare to find out.&quot;
HE_029	12	&quot;This is a move that involves additional discrimination, albeit less, but still discrimination, and all this under the guise of &#39;good news,&#39;&quot; says attorney Carmit Mizrahi Messer.
HE_029	13	&quot;The very existence of the parentage order procedure, instead of a simple declaration of parentage, as is customary in heterosexual couples, constitutes discrimination.
HE_029	14	The &#39;best interests of the child&#39; are only examined when it comes to LGBT couples.
HE_029	15	Today&#39;s LGBT community is not satisfied with apparent arrangements and the request that they not make cheap election exercises on us.&quot;
HE_029	16	The chairman of the LGBT Association, Chen Arieli, said that the reform is the first result of the community&#39;s adoption protest from the summer of 2017.
HE_029	17	&quot;We are waiting for the ombudsman&#39;s approval of the immediate adoption of the conclusions and their implementation.
HE_029	18	This is an important step towards a comprehensive solution, but the road there is still long for the recognition of our families.
HE_029	19	Discrimination is discrimination and it must be eradicated fundamentally and completely, not with partial concessions.&quot;
HE_029	20	Attorney Iris Sheinfeld, an expert in family law and LGBT families who was a member of the committee that formulated the reform, said that &quot;this is an important day in our fight for true equality, which was achieved mainly thanks to intensive and long-term work to change the perception of the legal system.
HE_029	21	The committee&#39;s recommendations bring with them two pieces of news - one is that the process for a parentage order will become simpler and more accessible even during the pregnancy stage, so that the recognition of parentage will be immediate.
HE_029	22	And the second is that the very decision to have a child together is a decision of no return, even in the event that the couple separates and this is a significant way of perceiving the parents as equals without favoring the biological parent.
HE_029	23	There is no doubt that progress can be seen in the state&#39;s position towards LGBT families.
HE_029	24	At the same time, our road to full equality is still long and we will continue to work until it is achieved,&quot; she said.
HE_029	25	Idan Roll, chairman of the proud headquarters of Yesh Atid and a candidate for the Knesset, said that &quot;Minister Katz&#39;s reform is a step in the right direction, but the new procedure also discriminates against straight couples.
HE_029	26	The right to start a family is a fundamental right that our evil government denies to the gay community time and time again, from the discriminatory adoption law to the surrogacy law, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to amend and then voted against us as part of a cynical and ugly spin on the backs of couples whose whole dream is to become parents.&quot;
HE_029	27	&quot;The good thing is that the committee was able to see the difficulties of LGBT families who have to jump through a series of hoops in order to recognize legal parentage for both,&quot; said Attorney Victoria Gelfand, who owns a law firm in the field of overseas surrogacy and LGBT rights.
HE_029	28	&quot;The bad thing is that this is not yet the end of the verse, and it will be interesting to see if and how the recommendations will be approved by the Attorney General.
HE_029	29	The ugly thing is that many times initiatives and promises given during elections - disappear with the establishment of a new government.&quot;
HE_031	1	Hundreds of pensioners blocked the Azrieli intersection in protest of the pension cuts
HE_031	2	Less than two weeks before the entry into force of the 270,000 insured in the eight old pension funds in the &quot;Amitim&quot; arrangement, 800 of them demonstrated this morning (Tuesday) in front of the government building in Tel Aviv and briefly blocked the Azrieli intersection, which was reopened to traffic.
HE_031	3	The retirees carried signs that read, among other things: &quot;No to circumcision for pensions&quot;, &quot;Bibi, don&#39;t throw it away for pension&quot;, &quot;Kahlon, you promised not to cut - keep it&quot;, &quot;Ministers raised - cut for the elderly&quot; and &quot;The elections are over, the elderly were forgotten&quot;.
HE_031	4	In response to the cut in combat pensions, the Ministry of Finance said: &quot;The issue is being addressed, but no decision has been made yet.&quot;
HE_031	5	Starting June 1, for the first time ever, the retirees&#39; pensions will be cut by 1.26%, which amounts to about NIS 1,000 per year.
HE_031	6	This is due to the heavy deficits that accumulated as a result of not raising the retirement age for women from 62 to 64, as previously agreed upon.
HE_031	7	Today, the funds are in a deficit of about NIS 5 billion, which grows by about NIS 200 million a year.
HE_031	8	Retired Yehezkel Engler (85), a Holocaust survivor who for 40 years was a civilian employee of the IDF, said that &quot;the retired are not the &#39;ATM&#39; of the Ministry of Finance.
HE_031	9	We have worked all our lives to ensure our old age with dignity and now the Treasury wants to cut my pension because of a debate that does not concern me about raising the retirement age for women.
HE_031	10	When the government during the time of Bibi as Minister of Finance took over the management of the funds, it also received many assets such as the convalescent home of &#39;Insurers&#39; in Zichron Ya&#39;akov.
HE_031	11	Moreover, during the great increases in the capital market, large funds such as mine, &#39;Mfathim&#39;, helped with our money in the absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union by agreeing to double their pensions.&quot;
HE_031	12	&quot;Avigdor Lieberman has about 50,000 pensioners who came from there, so he makes it a condition of entering the government that they ensure their old age with dignity.
HE_031	13	Most of the factions in the Knesset do not care about the elderly and for most of those candidates to join the new government - the elderly are not on the agenda.
HE_031	14	We who built the country will not agree to be held hostage by the treasury.
HE_031	15	That Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon will keep his promise that he also gave to the Histadrut of the Pensioners not to cut pensions because he said himself that he would not let &#39;our parents&#39; be harmed, so he will keep it.
HE_031	16	Shmulik Mizrahi, chairman of the Histadrut Hagamelaim, which organized the demonstration, added: &quot;The pensioners are not a party to the debate about the retirement age of women, neither hostages nor an ATM of the treasury officials.
HE_031	17	Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon repeated and promised not to cut, but so far he has not ordered his officials to cancel the cut.
HE_031	18	The average salary increases and pensions, like benefits, decrease every year.
HE_031	19	The generation of the country&#39;s founders will not agree to be the Eskimos of the government.
HE_031	20	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who as finance minister signed the decision to transfer the management of the funds to the government, should fulfill his commitment and prevent the cut on June 1.&quot;
HE_031	21	The chairman of the pensioners&#39; lobby, MK Itzik Shmoli (Labor Party), who participated in the demonstration, said that &quot;the first decision this government made was to inflate itself without limit with jobs and ministerial positions.
HE_031	22	The second decision is to raise the price of water and harm the pensions of the elderly.
HE_031	23	Only a month ago they promised the elderly to raise their allowances and now not only are they not increasing but they are threatening to hurt them.
HE_031	24	to forget about it.
HE_031	25	The elderly will not be their small pot.&quot;
HE_031	26	Already in March 2018, Yoav Ben Or, the special director of the old pension funds, announced the expected cut, but following public pressure, accompanied by a demonstration by pensioners, the move was postponed until June 2019.
HE_031	27	The Deputy Minister of Finance, Yitzhak Cohen (Shas), said at the time that his office would not allow a cut in allowances.
HE_031	28	&quot;The directive of Minister Moshe Kahlon is unequivocal,&quot; Cohen told Ynet, &quot;there will be no situation for anyone to deduct rights for pensioners in order to solve the problem of raising the retirement age for women.
HE_031	29	I spoke today with the chairman of the Histadrut, Avi Nissenkorn, and told him that he has no reason to put up barricades.
HE_031	30	It won&#39;t happen and there&#39;s no need for demonstrations.&quot;
HE_031	31	In September 2018, the fund managers received another notification about the expected cut starting in June 2019, and again a public protest arose, which this time even received the backing of the Histadrut chairman at the time, Avi Nissenkorn, who threatened a general strike if the move was implemented, as first published in Ynet.
HE_031	32	A day later, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon (all of us) pledged to cancel the planned cut.
HE_031	33	&quot;He won&#39;t get up and won&#39;t be on my shift,&quot; Kahlon declared.
HE_031	34	&quot;The pension benefits will not be affected and certainly not the old age benefits.
HE_031	35	Just as we increased by billions the budgets for the elderly who receive income guarantees, so we will make sure that in the future there will be no harm to all of our parents.&quot;
HE_031	36	MK Tali Ploskov (Kulanu), chairman of the committee to build a national master plan for the elderly, added at the time that &quot;I spoke urgently with Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon about the deficits in the pension funds and the fact that these deficits endanger the pensions of about a quarter of a million elderly people.
HE_031	37	I am happy to announce that a solution has been found and there will be no cut in the public&#39;s pension benefits and certainly not in the old age benefits.&quot;
HE_031	38	Despite the announcements of the two, the cut has already begun to be implemented in practice for those who have withdrawn funds from the funds since last September.
HE_031	39	The office of the Minister of Finance Moshe Kahlon stated that it is not in a position to intervene in the issue during the transitional government and that the response should be addressed to the Capital Markets, Insurance and Savings Authority.
HE_031	40	There was no response from the Authority.
HE_032	1	Gafni refused the demand to delay budget transfers until a debate on the deficit is held
HE_032	2	The Chairman of the Finance Committee MK Moshe Gafni (Torah Judaism) initiates a discussion in the Committee on the amount of the deficit in the state budget to which the Commissioner of Budgets at the Treasury Shaul Meridor and the Accountant General at the Treasury Roni Hezekiah will be invited.
HE_032	3	Gafni said these things this morning (Tuesday) at the beginning of the meeting of the committee that will discuss budgetary transfers to the state budget in the amount of NIS 9.5 billion.
HE_032	4	He refused the demand of MKs to delay the transfers before this discussion takes place.
HE_032	5	As Calcalist revealed the other day, Gafni and Minister of Finance Moshe Kahlon held a &quot;deal&quot; in the framework of which the Treasury forwarded all budget requests for committee approval along with two proposals to cut the budget.
HE_032	6	MK Orit Perkash-HaCohen (Blue and White) demanded to hold a debate on the deficit before the Finance Committee approves the budgetary transfers.
HE_032	7	&quot;I want to understand where we are going.
HE_032	8	I feel uncomfortable when I read about the excess in the deficit, there is room for flexibility.
HE_032	9	In a few weeks there may be a new finance minister.
HE_032	10	We are supposed to know where we are going,&quot; said Parkash-HaCohen.
HE_032	11	Gafni rejected this and said that budget transfers should not be delayed.
HE_032	12	&quot;I met with the Minister of Finance on Thursday and told him that the country cannot be paralyzed just because the budget department does not offer the budget transfers,&quot; Gafni said.
HE_032	13	&quot;These transfers are routine things.
HE_032	14	The state functions through the ministries or through the transfer of surpluses from last year or transfers that are transferred to the various ministries.
HE_032	15	Some things are really essential.
HE_032	16	I have been asking for many weeks the commissioner of budgets to forward these references for the committee&#39;s approval.
HE_032	17	My interest is for the government offices to be able to function.
HE_032	18	I want to praise the butchers department who brought all the references.
HE_032	19	Budget requests that were not approved today will be approved in the coming days.&quot;
HE_032	20	Funding for ultra-orthodox special education.
HE_032	21	As part of the budget transfers, the Ministry of Finance transferred an amount of NIS 7.6 million to fund ultra-orthodox special education.
HE_032	22	Gafni: &quot;I am fighting with all my might on the issue of special education and I am asking the members here on the committee to contact the Minister of Finance and the head of the budget department to bring the money to these children that they deserve by law.
HE_032	23	I have no tools at the moment to deal with them, as far as they are concerned I will not bring these transfers.
HE_032	24	This means that there will be no money for the hospitals, public transportation, the medicine basket, the Holocaust survivors, the food baskets, education, welfare and infrastructure.
HE_032	25	We are on the eve of passing the 2020 state budget, so we have tools.
HE_032	26	I am informing you here and now - we will not pass the state budget if the special education budget is not in it.&quot;
HE_032	27	Gafni emphasized that he is not satisfied with the summary forwarded to him according to which in 2020 priority will be given to the mochashar (unofficial seller): &quot;I want you to know: I cannot threaten the budget department because if I don&#39;t make transfers they will applaud.
HE_032	28	I&#39;m not sure they want the transfers done.
HE_032	29	I fight with all my might for the mochashar like all the friends who don&#39;t want there to be discrimination.
HE_032	30	I ask other Knesset members to put the main pressure on the Ministry of Finance.&quot;
HE_032	31	MK Shlomo Karai (Likud) said that the summary regarding the prioritization of the Mochashar in 2020 should not be underestimated.
HE_032	32	He emphasized that &quot;my pressure levers will be activated in full force&quot; in 2020.
HE_032	33	As for canceling parental subsidies in Hanukkah schools, in view of the budgeting of after-school programs, Gafni said: &quot;I cannot agree to that.
HE_032	34	I&#39;m not going to leave this situation as it is.&quot;
HE_032	35	MK Miki Levy (Blue and White): &quot;I am happy that after months of paralysis and just before government programs and government ministries stop and reduce activity - the finance committee is meeting to approve billions of shekels that will allow a little &#39;oxygen&#39; for the education, health, welfare, transportation and other systems.
HE_032	36	However, alongside critical budgets for the activities of the government ministries, I was surprised to discover requests to transfer tens of millions of shekels to finance the Prime Minister&#39;s trips abroad, which of course I do not intend to support.&quot;
HE_032	37	Levy referred to the request to transfer NIS 1.6 billion to the Ministry of Transportation, NIS 1.4 billion of which is for public transportation.
HE_032	38	&quot;This is a project whose viability is questionable - I intend to demand from the Ministry of Transportation, before even the members of the committee get to examine this request, to release the procurement tenders for buses from the Israeli companies, in accordance with the Mutual Procurement Law, and to end the farce of disobeying court orders before the collapse of the Israeli bus manufacturing industry.
HE_032	39	At a time when the Ministry of Finance and its leader led to a huge deficit of over 50 billion shekels, there is no reason to approve a budget request of 1.6 billion shekels in favor of a controversial transportation project, which is estimated at several tens of billions more.&quot;
HE_043	1	Deri obtained 700 million shekels for food security, but it is not clear who will benefit from them
HE_043	2	Today, the Knesset approved 700 million shekels for vulnerable groups as part of the economic plan at the request of Interior Minister Aryeh Deri.
HE_043	3	But the money is intended to go through the local authorities and not through the Ministry of Labor and Welfare.
HE_043	4	The funds are defined as &quot;food security&quot; and will be distributed as food vouchers, but the criteria proposed by Deri for the distribution of the funds were based on receiving property tax discounts and the number of children, that is, tailors for ultra-Orthodox families.
HE_043	5	The meaning of Deri&#39;s method is bypassing the welfare departments that have lists of the needy as well as bypassing the National Council for Food Security.
HE_043	6	It is not yet known what the final criteria will be.
HE_043	7	On Saturday night, Deri addressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Israel Katz with the demand to provide a budget of NIS 3 billion to help a thousand families who receive property tax discounts of over 70%.
HE_043	8	According to the proposal, families with more than 7 people will receive NIS 2,500 per month in the next ten months, families with 4-6 people will receive NIS 2,000 and families up to 3 people will receive NIS 1,500.
HE_043	9	Deri did not hide in the letter that he was referring to the populations that receive scholarships, i.e. the Abrakhs.
HE_043	10	It is still not clear according to which criteria the funds Deri obtained will be distributed.
HE_043	11	If the original intention to distribute the money to 150 thousand families is maintained, then each family will receive between 400 and 600 shekels per month.
HE_043	12	In a letter to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Israel Katz that he sent on Saturday night, Deri wrote: &quot;There are extremely weak populations in Israeli society from the various sectors, the ultra-orthodox and the Arab, who are having a hard time in routine and even more so in the era of crisis.
HE_043	13	These populations benefit from supports and scholarships that originate from philanthropy, which as we know has significantly reduced the scope of support.&quot;
HE_043	14	Deri suggested giving the grant to any family entitled to a property tax discount of over 70%.
HE_043	15	It should be noted that tests for receiving a discount are done in advance according to per capita income criteria, meaning they are biased in favor of non-working couples who have many children.
HE_043	16	But Deri claimed that &quot;this criterion will provide an equal response without bias and any preferences and thus the support will reach the most needy and the most basic needs&quot;.
HE_043	17	He estimated the cost at NIS 300 million per month, which means NIS 3 billion by June 2021.
HE_043	18	Deri refused yesterday at a cabinet meeting to vote in favor of the economic plan until his claim is answered.
HE_043	19	Following the move, Finance Minister Israel Katz reached an agreement on an additional NIS 700 million for food security purposes, which was already approved today in the Economic Plan Law.
HE_043	20	However, the money is not intended for the shrinking food security budget of the Ministry of Labor and Welfare, which stands at NIS 20 million, but will go from the Ministry of the Interior to the local authorities.
HE_043	21	At the Shas faction meeting today, Deri claimed that the government&#39;s original plan helped employers, the self-employed, and the unemployed, &quot;but it lacked the fourth side, the weakened populations who did not receive any help from either this package or the previous one, and added to their hardship due to the corona virus, and I&#39;m really talking about bread and milk.
HE_043	22	&quot;This should help about 150,000 families according to clear and equal criteria of income tests through the local authorities.
HE_043	23	All sectors are included in the criteria.
HE_043	24	This is a historic day in terms of the Shas faction that from now on any plan that comes in Israel will also take this sector into account.&quot;
HE_043	25	Welfare Minister Itzik Shmoli has been fighting in recent days to obtain an amount of NIS 300 million for food security.
HE_043	26	Shmuli said he was happy that Deri joined the fight for food security funds and brought a larger amount.
HE_043	27	However, he said that &quot;the Ministry of the Interior does not know how to distribute food vouchers.
HE_043	28	A ministry cannot receive 700 million vouchers and distribute them however it wants.
HE_043	29	Otherwise it&#39;s a banana republic.
HE_043	30	There is no reason to bypass the welfare departments and the National Food Security Council.&quot;
HE_052	1	&quot;Moving to a global Jewish strategy&quot; today, 14:51
HE_052	2	The Israeli government adopted at its meeting this morning (Sunday) a comprehensive strategic outline, the first of its kind, to ensure the existence of the Jewish people in the Diaspora.
HE_052	3	The outline was presented by Diaspora Minister Omer Yankelevich, in the spirit of the conclusions of the special public committee established to examine the future of the Jewish people.
HE_052	4	The public committee was appointed about a year and a half ago, to examine government activity in the field of Diaspora Jews.
HE_052	5	The purpose of the committee is to plan the channels of communication between Israel and the Jewish communities in the world and to adapt the Zionist vision on the subject to the new reality.
HE_052	6	The committee was chaired by Maxine Pressberg, former CEO of Intel Israel and vice president of Intel Global, alongside Prof. Eugene Kendall, CEO of Start Up Nation and former chairman of the National Economic Council in the Prime Minister&#39;s Office.
HE_052	7	The committee examined the activity and developments in the field in recent years, and after hearing from professionals and content experts on the subject, determined that the state must present an overall strategic plan to secure the future of the Jewish people, with the focus of action being strengthening the relationship with the Jewish communities through a participatory approach, investing in formal and informal education, and strengthening the Jewish identity and the connection to Israel through various channels.
HE_052	8	All this, in full cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Absorption, the Jewish Agency, the national institutions, philanthropy and the Jewish communities.
HE_052	9	Further to the report and under the guidance of the Minister of the Diaspora, the professionals in the Ministry of the Diaspora formulated an extensive and groundbreaking strategic outline of principles, which includes areas of activity in securing the future of the Jewish people in the Diaspora, and expresses the committee&#39;s recommendations alongside many creative ideas, including systemic thinking that includes the activities of all the agencies dealing with the Diaspora , creation of global action platforms, and adequate resource support.
HE_052	10	In the spirit of the committee&#39;s recommendations, government action should focus on six areas: formal and informal education, activity in Israel, Tikun Olam, innovation and technology, assessment and measurement, and common purpose (details at the end of the press release).
HE_052	11	According to Minister Yankelevich: &quot;We are at a historic moment of decision as far as relations between the State of Israel and Diaspora Jewry are concerned.
HE_052	12	In this plan, we are moving from tactical operations to a global Jewish strategy.
HE_052	13	I thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz and the Cabinet Ministers for approving the historic decision.
HE_052	14	At the cabinet meeting there was a general agreement to invest in the issue.
HE_052	15	The Israeli government announced today that we are not only 7 million Jews living in Israel, but we are one great nation of 15 million Jews all over the world.
HE_052	16	The government&#39;s decision is to accept responsibility for the Jewish people, as required by the Declaration of Independence and the Nationality Law.
HE_052	17	The approved outline allows for the construction of a stable long-term strategic plan that does not depend on this other government.&quot;
HE_052	18	&quot;The corona epidemic sharpened the question of the State of Israel&#39;s commitment to Diaspora Jewry: does the State of Israel clearly accept upon itself the commitment to the future of the Jewish people and maintaining its existence.
HE_052	19	&quot;The implementation of the conclusions of the Fassberg-Kendall committee will make it possible to create strategic and global projects that will affect the future of the Jewish people for years to come,&quot; the minister added.
HE_052	20	Prof. Kendall noted, &quot;In order to change direction, there is an immediate need for a long-term strategic course backed by resources from the Israeli government while cooperating with all the communities in the world.
HE_052	21	Only in this way is there a chance to stop the collapse of many communities within one generation and the disconnection of a large number of young people from the people&quot; Maxine Pressberg added, &quot;If large parts of the Jewish people were in physical danger the State of Israel would not ask why protect them right now.
HE_052	22	Today, large parts of the world&#39;s Jews are destined to be cut off forever from the nation.
HE_052	23	Will we ask why now?&quot;
HE_056	1	Ramat Gan erected a fence blocking the passage from Bnei Brak
HE_056	2	The residents of Bnei Brak were amazed: the Ramat Gan municipality erected a fence that blocked the passage between the cities. A long fence was erected in the early hours of the morning at the buffer points between the city of Bnei Brak, which is under police blockade, and Ramat Gan.
HE_056	3	Residents walking along one of the boulevards encountered a checkpoint and were recorded.
HE_056	4	Ramat Gan Municipality admitted that they are behind the move: &quot;It is appropriate and correct to close and limit every loophole until the end of the quarantine.&quot;
HE_056	5	Bnei Brak: &quot;Criminal conduct, reminiscent of dark times&quot;
HE_056	6	The residents of Bnei Brak woke up this morning (Monday) to the continuation of the quarantine that the city is under following the corona crisis and the outbreak of the virus there.
HE_056	7	Residents walking the streets of Bnei Brak documented, to their astonishment, a fence erected by the Ramat Gan municipality in an attempt to prevent any pedestrian crossing between the cities.
HE_056	8	Eyewitnesses told N12 that they saw the maintenance crews erecting the wire fence.
HE_056	9	After the public uproar, the Ministry of the Interior ordered the municipality to remove the fence.
HE_056	10	Ramat Gan Municipality: &quot;It is proper and right to close every loophole until the end of the quarantine.&quot;
HE_056	11	Bnei Brak: &quot;Conduct of criminals, and reminiscent of dark periods in the Jewish past.&quot;
HE_056	12	Eyewitnesses, who woke up this morning to the sight of the fence that blocked the exit from the city, told N12 that they heard noises in the morning and saw Ramat Gan municipality maintenance teams that arrived at the same avenue placing the barbed wire fence on the border between the cities.
HE_056	13	The blocked crossing point is between Jerusalem Boulevard in Ramat Gan and Golomb Boulevard in Bnei Brak.
HE_056	14	The Ramat Gan Municipality stated: &quot;The Israel Police informed the Ramat Gan Municipality that due to a personnel shortage and multitasking, it is forced to leave several checkpoints out of the 70.
HE_056	15	Immediately, the unsecured points began to be used for crossing violators of the critical public health quarantine.
HE_056	16	Soft barriers by mobile barriers and signage were violated and roughly trampled.
HE_056	17	As long as the Israel Police does not return to block the points and as long as movement between the cities is prohibited according to the Public Health Responsibility Law, it leads to the conclusion that it is proper and correct to close and demarcate every loophole until the end of the quarantine.&quot;
HE_056	18	Despite these appearances, the mayor of Ramat Gan sounded completely different just about a week ago.
HE_056	19	In a post he published on Facebook, he came out against putting up any barrier or fence between the cities.
HE_056	20	&quot;We don&#39;t have the authority and time for that, and this is certainly not the time to build walls,&quot; he wrote.
HE_056	21	&quot;A wall is a medieval solution against plagues, and even then it did not prevent infection.&quot;
HE_056	22	A few hours after the fence was placed and the documentation from the checkpoint that caused an uproar was published, Bnei Brak municipality workers began to dismantle the fence erected by the Ramat Gan municipality.
HE_056	23	The dismantling was carried out following an order from the Director General of the Ministry of the Interior who stated that the municipality does not have the authority to carry out such a blockade.
HE_056	24	Bnei Brak strongly protested the move by the mayor of Ramat Gan, Carmel Shama HaCohen.
HE_056	25	In an official statement published on their behalf, it was stated: &quot;The Corona crisis will pass, but the inhuman behavior of Ramat Gan Mayor Carmel Shamma will be remembered forever.
HE_056	26	The man who tried to cut a political coupon on the plight of the residents of Bnei Brak when movement restrictions were imposed on them, erects fences around the ghetto he demanded to be established.&quot;
HE_056	27	&quot;The municipality of Bnei Brak strongly protests against a despicable and ugly act of &#39;good neighborliness&#39; on the part of the municipality of Ramat Gan, which chose a sickening step without any authority, as Interior Minister Aryeh Deri also stated.
HE_056	28	The residents of Bnei Brak are law-abiding and behave in accordance with the instructions, the establishment of fences is a violent step that suits the conduct of criminals, and reminds of dark periods in the Jewish past,&quot; it said.
HE_056	29	Mayor Rubinstein added: &quot;We will not allow fences, we will not agree to racist labeling and tarnishing an entire population.&quot;
HE_056	30	Shama Cohen responded to the harsh words directed at him and stated that he would not endanger the lives of the residents.
HE_056	31	&quot;No attack on me will make me make a decision that would endanger the life of one resident,&quot; he wrote on his Facebook account.
HE_056	32	&quot;In the last hour the media has been spreading two complete lies.
HE_056	33	The first lie - the Director General of the Ministry of the Interior never ordered me anything but helped my request to convince the Israel Police to close the loopholes.&quot;
HE_056	34	&quot;The second lie,&quot; continued Shamma HaCohen.
HE_056	35	&quot;According to the agreement with the acting mayor of Bnei Brak, no Bnei Brak municipality employee will touch anything in Ramat Gan.
HE_056	36	That is why the spokeswoman&#39;s statement full of blasphemy according to which &#39;Heroes of the Bnei Brak Municipality are on the way to break up&#39; is a complete lie and as soon as it is carried out and the agreements are violated we will respond accordingly.
HE_056	37	There will be no promiscuous crossings from Ramat Gan to Bnei Brak and vice versa, endangering the lives of the residents of both cities.
HE_056	38	As much as they are and are not taken care of - we will take care of them.&quot;
HE_056	39	Did you find a mistake?
HE_059	1	The drop in apartment prices will not necessarily help buyers
HE_059	2	A 2.2% increase in household incomes, a 0.15% decrease in mortgage interest and a 0.3% decrease in apartment prices - all of these made it easier to buy an apartment in the first quarter of 2020, which was only ultimately affected by the corona epidemic.
HE_059	3	This is according to the ability to purchase an apartment index of the Elrov Institute for Real Estate Research at the Kohler Faculty of Management at Tel Aviv University, in collaboration with Calcalist.
HE_059	4	&quot;The three components of the index came together and made it easier for buyers, which led to the most significant improvement in the equity index in six years,&quot; says Prof. Danny Ben Shahar, head of the Alrov Institute, who conducted the study together with Yarin Mani, a research fellow at the institute.
HE_059	5	However, despite the sharp drop in transactions during the Corona days and the plight of developers and apartment sellers looking for buyers, Ben Shahar is not optimistic about the near term: &quot;I estimate that the increase in wages and the decrease in mortgages in the first quarter have already been erased, and we are likely to see a significant increase in mortgage interest rates, which will immediately translate into a negative Ability to purchase housing.
HE_059	6	&quot;In addition, with or without the corona virus, every year households that need housing join, so I am skeptical about significant decreases in housing prices, certainly in the areas of demand.
HE_059	7	It is difficult to see the sellers dropping 20% ​​in apartment prices, and even if we see a 5-10% drop in apartment prices, this may be accompanied by a significant increase in mortgage interest, which can wipe out any moderate drop in apartment prices.&quot;
HE_059	8	It is possible that in the periphery the trend will be different: &quot;There is of course a large excess demand in greater Tel Aviv, but it is difficult to claim this for the periphery.&quot;
HE_059	9	The Elrov Institute index examines two main parameters that reflect the situation of apartment buyers: the average monthly repayment required to purchase an average four-room apartment in Israel with a financing rate of 70%, and the average equity required to purchase an average four-room apartment in Israel (so that the current monthly payment does not exceed 30% from the net income).
HE_059	10	The average monthly repayment data indicated a decrease of 1.6% compared to the previous quarter (NIS 7,689).
HE_059	11	Compared to the corresponding quarter last year, there was a decrease of 4.6%.
HE_059	12	In eight of the 12 large cities examined, there was a decrease in the first quarter of this year compared to the previous quarter.
HE_059	13	In the last year, there was a decrease in the index in all 12 cities examined.
HE_059	14	The required equity also reflected a 5% decrease compared to the previous quarter and reached NIS 880,000.
HE_059	15	In the 12 cities examined, there was a decrease in the required equity capital in the first quarter of this year.
HE_059	16	And yet, a household in the sixth decile is only able to purchase an apartment in Beer Sheva, Haifa and Hadera.
HE_059	17	A household in the seventh decile is able to afford a monthly repayment even in Ashdod and Petah Tikva.
HE_059	18	A household in the eighth decile can also purchase in Rehovot, Bat Yam, Rishon Lezion, Bnei Brak and Jerusalem.
HE_059	19	In Tel Aviv, only households in the tenth decile can purchase an apartment.
HE_059	20	The concern that is currently arising is what is expected to happen in the coming quarters, this in light of an increase that can already be seen in the mortgage data, and against the background of high unemployment data that will affect the average wage in the economy in the coming quarters. &quot;20% unemployment can be a significant blow to the housing market,&quot; emphasizes Ben Shahar.
HE_062	1	Israel and Bahrain announced the establishment of diplomatic relations: &quot;More countries are on the way&quot;
HE_062	2	Israel and Bahrain have agreed on the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the two countries - this is what US President Donald Trump announced this evening (Friday) on his Twitter account.
HE_062	3	This, after a telephone conversation between the American President, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and the King of Bahrain Hamed bin Issa Al-Khalifa.
HE_062	4	The White House announced that the Foreign Minister of Bahrain, Abdel-Latif Al-Ziyani, will sign a peace declaration between Israel and Bahrain next week with Netanyahu at the White House.
HE_062	5	&quot;Another historic breakthrough today!
HE_062	6	Our two friends Israel and Bahrain reached a peace agreement - the second Arab country to make peace with Israel within 30 days,&quot; tweeted the American president.
HE_062	7	According to Trump, there is great enthusiasm on the part of other countries to make normalization agreements with Israel.
HE_062	8	The Prime Minister welcomed the normalization of relations with the Kingdom.
HE_062	9	&quot;I am excited to inform you that tonight we will reach another peace agreement with another Arab country, with Bahrain,&quot; Netanyahu said this evening.
HE_062	10	&quot;This joins the historic peace agreement with the United Arab Emirates.
HE_062	11	It took us 26 years to get from the second peace agreement with an Arab country to the third peace agreement, and it took us not 26 years but 29 days to reach the peace agreement between the third Arab country and the fourth Arab country and there will be more.&quot;
HE_062	12	&quot;This is a new era of peace.
HE_062	13	Peace for peace.
HE_062	14	Economy for economy,&quot; Netanyahu added.
HE_062	15	&quot;We have invested in peace for many years and now peace will invest in us, will result in very large investments for Israel&#39;s economy and this is very important.
HE_062	16	All these agreements are made by hard work behind the scenes for years, but they came to fruition thanks to the important help of our friend the President of the United States, President Trump, and I would like to thank him and his team for this important help.&quot;
HE_062	17	The political adviser of the King of Bahrain, Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, said that &quot;the announcement on the establishment of relations with Israel serves security and stability in the Middle East.
HE_062	18	This is a positive message towards the people of Israel according to which a just and inclusive peace with the Palestinian people is the best way and it serves the real interests of all the peoples of the region.&quot;
HE_062	19	According to the Bahrain News Agency, the king told Trump and Netanyahu in the three-way phone call that a just and inclusive peace between Israel and the Palestinians must be reached as a strategic choice and based on the two-state solution and UN resolutions.
HE_062	20	After the announcement, Trump said that he &quot;thinks that a lot of good things can happen now with the Palestinians as well.&quot;
HE_062	21	However, the PLO condemned the announcement of the establishment of relations between Israel and Bahrain, saying that it was a &quot;betrayal of the Palestinian issue&quot;.
HE_062	22	Hamas joined the talks and said: &quot;The normalization agreement between Israel and Bahrain is an insistence on implementing the clauses of the &#39;Deal of the Century&#39; which eliminates the Palestinian issue.&quot;
HE_062	23	&quot;We believe that other countries will normalize relations with Israel&quot; Earlier today, the National Security Advisor of the United States Robert O&#39;Brien gave a speech at the Interdisciplinary Center conference in Herzliya, in which he stated that he believes that Arab countries other than the United Arab Emirates will sign an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with Israel.
HE_062	24	&quot;We believe that other Arab and Muslim countries will soon follow the path of the United Arab Emirates and normalize relations with Israel,&quot; he said.
HE_062	25	O&#39;Brien&#39;s words join President Trump&#39;s statement tonight, according to which another country may soon join the political agreement signed between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
HE_062	26	The Trump administration, which is expected to host the signing ceremony for the agreement next Tuesday together with the delegations of Israel and the United Arab Emirates, has tried to get other countries in the Gulf, such as Bahrain and Oman, to join the normalization with Israel.
HE_062	27	Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed last month to normalize relations, in a deal that Trump helped broker.
HE_062	28	He did not reveal the name of the country that might be next to join, but predicted that Saudi Arabia would eventually do so.
HE_062	29	&quot;You will hear about other countries entering into an agreement in the near future, and we will be able to have peace in the Middle East,&quot; he said.
HE_062	30	In the last weeks since the signing of the normalization agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, the White House has pressured Bahrain to join the move and normalize relations with Israel.
HE_062	31	President Trump&#39;s senior advisor Jared Kushner and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Manama separately, and met with the king and crown prince and asked them to announce normalization - even before the signing ceremony at the White House of the agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
HE_062	32	Last week, the government of Bahrain announced that it had accepted the request of the government of the United Arab Emirates to allow flights between the United Arab Emirates and Israel to pass through its airspace.
HE_062	33	The decision gave a boost to the normalization agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
HE_062	34	The announcement is considered a normalization step on the part of Bahrain.
HE_063	1	The OECD: &quot;Israel entered the crisis in good economic condition, but in danger of widening the gaps&quot;
HE_063	2	The authors of the report state that the government may be forced to invest additional budgets in additional aid programs, but that this should be done with budgetary restraint as much as possible.
HE_063	3	The report also states that taxation in Israel on work is relatively low, while taxation on consumption is high.
HE_063	4	In addition, they point out that the proportion of poor workers is high, and that the tax credits for workers have a positive effect on low-skilled workers.
HE_063	5	The authors of the report claim that programs should be expanded to support the poor and at the same time provide incentives to encourage work.
HE_063	6	The fund&#39;s economists state, however, that the Israeli economy is currently in a severe crisis &quot;like most countries in the world&quot;, and that it will take time to recover from it.
HE_063	7	In 2021, a significant improvement is indeed expected, if the incidence of Corona does not worsen significantly in the coming months, but next year&#39;s figures are still very far from returning to the situation that existed in the Israeli economy before the crisis, in January and February of this year.
HE_063	8	According to the OECD forecast, the unemployment rate in 2019, which was 3.8%, will rise to 6.1% this year and to 6.5% in 2021, meaning that the employment situation in the Israeli economy will remain dire next year as well.
HE_063	9	The deficit in the state budget in relation to GDP, which in 2019 amounted to only 3.9%, also well above the target set by the government (2.9%), will reach this year according to the forecast of the Organization of Developed Countries a record negative rate of 13.8%.
HE_063	10	In 2021, the crisis will continue and the deficit will still stand at a double-digit rate of 10.3%, mainly due to the continuation of the government&#39;s obligations regarding the Corona crisis, with the payment of grants and compensation to businesses and the payment of unemployment benefits to those staying in Halat until at least June 2021.
HE_063	11	Israel&#39;s debts, which have already fallen to a low of 60% of the gross national product in 2019, one of the lowest in the world, will jump to 77% this year and in 2021 will even rise to 84.7% of the GDP, a figure the country had in the previous decade.
HE_063	12	According to the report, the GDP per capita in Israel amounts to approximately 38,000 dollars, only slightly below the average in the OECD countries, where the average is approximately 42,000 dollars per capita.
HE_063	13	According to the report, the table of countries is led by the small country Luxembourg with about 107 thousand dollars per capita.
HE_063	14	It is followed by Ireland with 83 thousand dollars per capita, and Switzerland third with 67 thousand dollars per capita.
HE_063	15	Israel is located at the bottom of the table and with a figure almost identical to that of Spain, the Czech Republic, Italy and New Zealand, whose GDP is about 39 thousand dollars per capita.
HE_063	16	The Minister of Finance, Israel Katz, said: &quot;I welcome the cooperation with the organization and the organization&#39;s clear statement that it is right at this time to continue to promote the supportive economic policy, and for the fact that Israel entered the Corona crisis in a good state.
HE_063	17	This is a significant report made mainly by teamwork and fruitful cooperation between the OECD organization and the government ministries in Israel, and I will examine the organization&#39;s recommendations to promote reforms and structural changes as part of the future economic plans.&quot;
HE_063	18	The Secretary General of the OECD, Angel Goria: &quot;The commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Israel&#39;s accession to the OECD, which we are celebrating this year, was, unfortunately, affected by the outbreak of the Corona epidemic.
HE_063	19	The past decade was marked by the realization of the fruitful cooperation between Israel and the OECD.
HE_063	20	Israel learned closely about the best practices and adopted standards of excellence of the member states of the organization, which helped it to make amazing progress in increasing employment and raising the standard of living.
HE_063	21	While Israel, like the countries of the world, is dealing with the epidemic, the OECD organization will continue to offer all the support we can through the publication of studies, dialogue and the formulation of data-based recommendations regarding socio-economic policies that we hope will help Israel return to a path of green, inclusive and sustainable growth &quot;.
HE_063	22	The chief economist of the OECD, Lawrence Boone: &quot;The global corona crisis hit just when Israel&#39;s economy was functioning well.
HE_063	23	In the ten years since joining the OECD, Israel has reduced the unemployment rate, raised the standard of living and reduced the public debt ratio.
HE_063	24	Israel should continue its efforts to protect people and companies, revive growth and prevent the crisis from exacerbating key challenges such as high inequality and gaps in productivity between high technology industries and traditional industries.&quot;
HE_075	1	The government is considering: the capsule system will be fundamentally canceled, the 5th-6th graders will come to the schools
HE_075	2	Will the return-to-school plan of the Minister of Education, Yoav Galant, collapse even before the start of the school year?
HE_075	3	Despite the high morbidity figures, government officials are considering the possibility of canceling the capsule system in grades 3-6, and switching to going to school as usual, under more limited restrictions.
HE_075	4	The goal is to enable the 5th-6th grade students, who are supposed to come to school only twice a week, to come to school normally.
HE_075	5	Although the school year is expected to open in a few days, officials in the education system have been formulating alternative plans to those presented by the Ministry of Education in recent days.
HE_075	6	In the event that the proposal is implemented, the capsule model in elementary schools will be canceled; The recruitment of thousands of additional teachers will be frozen; And the computer procurement procedure, which has already been rejected by the Ministry of Education, will be canceled or significantly reduced.
HE_075	7	According to sources in the education system, the change in the activity schedule of the schools will probably take place during the holidays, with the aim of reducing the load on the system.
HE_075	8	That is, the school year will begin with the Galant plan, and it will be canceled after the Tishri holidays - then the students of the 5th-6th grades will return to school.
HE_075	9	The outline of the Ministry of Education was not seriously discussed in the government and was not approved by the Corona cabinet.
HE_075	10	It is also not compatible with the traffic light system that the Corona projector, Prof. Roni Gamzo, is trying to implement, according to which studies will not open in red communities (with high morbidity).
HE_075	11	Education Minister Galant aims to open the school year fully throughout the country, but the constraints and problems in implementing the plan, as well as voices in the government and the Knesset, call for changing the outline.
HE_075	12	However, today (Monday) Galant Gamzo concluded that the school year will start on September 1 in accordance with the outline of the Ministry of Education, and that the possibility of postponing the start of studies for high school students will be examined.
HE_075	13	The decision will be discussed towards the end of August.
HE_075	14	Another possibility that is being considered by the government as a substitute for canceling the capsule system is a shift to a system of studying in shifts in the schools - according to which the studies in grades 3-6 will be carried out in capsules, but only for a few hours in the morning and afternoon shifts.
HE_075	15	However, this method has other difficulties, as it requires the parents to adjust their work to the children&#39;s shifts, and does not allow the operation of after-school programs.
HE_075	16	&quot;Leaving the 5th-12th students at home is a crime&quot; Sources in the education system and the government estimate that the Ministry of Education will make significant changes in the published return-to-school outline, due to various problems encountered.
HE_075	17	Even earlier, there was concern in the education system that the Ministry of Education&#39;s outline would run into difficulties, and would be canceled during the school year, because of difficulties in keeping the 5th-6th graders at home; difficulties in purchasing computers for distance learning; and difficulties in recruiting and relying on thousands of teachers without appropriate training and education in a temporary position.
HE_075	18	Due to the many difficulties in implementing the outline, which has not yet been fully published, it may be canceled during the year - which will lead to the shutdown of the kindergarten system or alternatively to the cancellation of the studies in capsules during the year.
HE_075	19	According to the Ministry of Education&#39;s return-to-school outline, which has been named &quot;Learning in safety&quot;, studies in kindergartens and grades 1-2 will take place as usual without capsules and without keeping a distance, in classes of up to 35 students - but the rest of the students in grades 7-12 will study remotely .
HE_075	20	The outline allows only the 3rd-4th graders to come to school for five days a week, in capsules, while the rest of the 5th-12th graders will only go to school twice a week - but the school principals are having trouble coming up with an arrangement that would allow this because the 3rd-4th graders They study in classes designed for fifth-fifth graders.
HE_075	21	The outline encounters additional difficulties: it depends on the recruitment of 13,000 new teachers on hourly wages - half of them without any training, experience or academic degree, who are supposed to teach the 3rd-4th grade students for half of the school day.
HE_075	22	It will be difficult for the education system to rely on temporary personnel in the long term, and in addition, no additional teachers have been recruited that would allow the students of grades 5-12 to be split into capsules.
HE_075	23	Also, the outline depends on the purchase of hundreds of thousands of computers - some for the classrooms where no computers are installed at all, and some for the 20% of students who do not have a computer at home.
HE_075	24	The procurement procedure for the computers by the Ministry of Education encountered difficulties and has not yet been implemented.
HE_075	25	In addition, the parents&#39; leadership representing the municipal parents&#39; committees opposes the outline, and demands that it be changed to allow the students of grades 5-6 to attend school.
HE_075	26	In a joint hearing of the Education and Corona Committee held today in the Knesset, the Deputy Director General of the Ministry of Health, Prof. Itamar Grotto, said that the curriculum for the 3rd-4th and 5th-6th grades will be discussed in the expert cabinet that advises the Ministry of Education and Prof. Roni Gamzo.
HE_075	27	The chairman of the Corona Committee, Yifat Shasha Biton, said that &quot;leaving the 5th-12th students at home is a crime.&quot;
HE_081	1	Andrew Abir assumed the position of Deputy Governor of the Bank of Israel Abir managed the markets division at the Bank of Israel, and oversaw the foreign exchange purchases made by the bank.
HE_081	2	He will assist Governor Amir Yaron in implementing the strategic plan he is formulating
HE_081	3	Andrew Abir begins his term as Deputy Governor of the Bank of Israel today (Sunday), after the government approved the appointment this morning, the Bank of Israel announced.
HE_081	4	Until now, and since 2011, Abir served as the director of the markets division at the central bank.
HE_081	5	The post of deputy governor has remained unfilled since the retirement of Dr. Nadine Budo-Trachtenberg at the end of February 2019.
HE_081	6	During this period, the governor met various candidates for the position of deputy governor, and his choice of Abir - and not an economist from the academy, for example - indicates his preference for an executive who can begin his work without the need for a learning period, and assist Yaron in the implementation of the strategic plan he has been formulating at the bank since his appointment as governor in December 2018.
HE_081	7	The plan includes, among other things, the adoption of technological innovation in the Bank of Israel and the entities subject to its supervision, and a leap forward in the payment systems in Israel.
HE_081	8	The governor will now be required to locate a new director for the markets division as well as a bank supervisor, a director for the human resources and administration division at the Bank of Israel, and possibly also a director for a new division in the field of payments and clearing, which the Bank of Israel is considering establishing.
HE_081	9	As part of his role in the markets division, Abir was responsible for the management of the bank&#39;s foreign exchange balances and the implementation of the bank&#39;s interest rate policy, and its policy in the foreign exchange market.
HE_081	10	According to the Bank of Israel law, the government appoints the deputy governor for a five-year term, and can appoint him for one additional term only.
HE_081	11	However, in the case of the appointment of a new governor, the term of office of the deputy governor ends one year after the appointment of the governor unless the government decides, according to the recommendation of the governor, that the deputy governor will continue to serve until the end of the term of office of his appointee.
HE_081	12	Amir Yaron, Governor of the Bank of Israel, Eyal Tuag, the Deputy Governor, serves as acting Governor in the event that his term ends or he is prevented from fulfilling his duties, as happened in 2013, when Prof. Karnit Flug filled the place of Prof. Stanley Fisher before he was officially appointed Governor, and as happened for several Shavuot in 2019, when Budo-Trachtenberg filled Flug&#39;s place until Yaron&#39;s appointment.
HE_081	13	Abir has been a member of the Bank of Israel&#39;s monetary committee since 2017, which is responsible, among other things, for setting interest rates in the economy.
HE_081	14	He started working at the Bank of Israel in 1987, as an economist, and from 2003 served as manager of the bank&#39;s foreign exchange transaction room, and from 2008 as deputy manager of the markets division and head of its financial division.
HE_081	15	Abir, born in Great Britain, has a bachelor&#39;s degree in economics and political science from the University of Oxford and a master&#39;s degree in business administration from the Hebrew University.
HE_081	16	As deputy governor, Abir will continue to serve on the monetary committee - but since the deputy governor is already a member of the committee, his appointment as deputy governor will free up another seat on the committee for another Bank of Israel employee, appointed by the governor.
HE_081	17	Currently, the committee consists of five members out of six in its full composition, due to the absence of a deputy to the governor.
HE_081	18	Abir will also serve as a member of the Bank of Israel&#39;s administrative board, which he joined in March 2019.
HE_081	19	In November, after the bank&#39;s latest interest rate decision, Abir explained in an interview with the Reuters news agency that in his opinion, intervening in the foreign exchange market and not reducing interest rates is the best way, at the present time, to support the economy and raise inflation within the target range of the central bank.
HE_081	20	&quot;The room for action when it comes to the interest rate is limited,&quot; said Abir, referring to the fact that the interest rate in Israel (0.25%) is already close to zero - &quot;while theoretically, there is unlimited room for buying dollars.&quot;
HE_081	21	The Bank of Israel under the direction of Abir - purchased almost 7 billion dollars since October 2019, and the bank&#39;s foreign exchange balances jumped to a new record, 130 billion dollars (as of the end of January 2020).
HE_081	22	According to the announcement published by the Bank of Israel in January, when the governor recommended to the government the appointment of Abir as deputy governor, Abir, as part of his duties at the bank, headed an inter-ministerial team to deal with the consequences of the global financial crisis on the financial markets in Israel, participated in the integration of the economy into the International Payments System (CLS), served as a consultant on behalf of the International Monetary Fund to central banks in the world, and implemented advanced trading systems to manage Israel&#39;s foreign exchange balances.
HE_081	23	As manager of the markets division, he serves as a director on behalf of the Bank of Israel at the Stock Exchange.
HE_081	24	Governor Yaron said: &quot;I thank the Prime Minister and the ministers for accepting my recommendation to appoint Andrew Abir as Deputy Governor, and the members of the Committee for Senior Appointments who checked the suitability of the appointment and approved it.
HE_081	25	I wish Andrew great success in his role and am confident in his success.&quot;
HE_081	26	The appointment of Abir during the transitional government required a special opinion from the Attorney General.
HE_081	27	The consultant&#39;s office decided that in view of the unusual duration of the election period, the appointment should be allowed.
HE_085	1	With masks, tests and great excitement: 2,458,000 start the school year
HE_085	2	2,458,000 students will start the new school year this morning (Wednesday), after most of last year had to be spent in online studies and in a disrupted way due to the Corona crisis.
HE_085	3	Last night, the Ministry of Education published the final and full outline for the start of the year, amid fears that the return to school will lead to a significant increase in the incidence of the virus. 176,000 children will take their first steps in school and begin studying in first grade.
HE_085	4	In the 2015 academic year there are 5,360 schools, an increase of one thousand institutions compared to last year, alongside 21 thousand kindergartens.
HE_085	5	A total of 79,000 classrooms will open their doors this year, an increase of 19,000 compared to last year.
HE_085	6	The budget of the Ministry of Education in 2022 is NIS 67.1 billion.
HE_085	7	240,000 students will still be forced to start the school year remotely, including about 150,000 8th-12th grade students in red municipalities who study in classes with less than 70% isolation exemptions and vaccinations, and another 90,000 isolated.
HE_085	8	The final figure will be published by the control center.
HE_085	9	According to the director general of the Ministry of Education, Yigal Slovik, there are 4,516 classes where less than 70% are vaccinated. 4,213 teachers and staff members are also in isolation. 9.9% of the tests conducted on Monday among students and teachers were found to be positive. 756,769 students received the first dose of the vaccine , and 580,311 are defined as vaccinated, a number that constitutes 24.2% of all students.
HE_085	10	According to the Director General of the Ministry of Education, 87% of the teaching staff are vaccinated against Corona, while approximately 18 thousand teaching staff and 18 thousand teaching supporters are not vaccinated and will be required to undergo tests to enter the schools.
HE_085	11	According to the final and full outline published last night by the Ministry of Education, in the communities defined by the Ministry of Health as green, yellow and orange - kindergartens, daycare centers, and grades 1-12 will hold full learning according to the fixed time system, all days of the week.
HE_085	12	In red settlements - in the kindergartens, in grades 1-4 and in afternoon classes, learning will be conducted as usual, within the frameworks.
HE_085	13	In grades 5-7, learning will continue but while taking actions to &quot;reduce contacts&quot; in orange and red communities.
HE_085	14	The intention is that schools will be able to decide to study in a group format or in an open area or in another format.
HE_085	15	On the other hand, in the 8th-12th grades in the red authorities, the students will switch to learning in an open area or to distance learning if the class has less than 70% isolation exemptions.
HE_085	16	The isolation exempt group includes those who are recovering, vaccinated with a second vaccine and positive in a serological test.
HE_085	17	In addition, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett decided last night that 8th-12th grade students who received the first dose of vaccination will be considered vaccinated, this during the month of September only, after which they will be required to complete the second vaccination dose in order to be considered vaccinated.
HE_085	18	The Minister of Education, Yifat Shasha-Biton, said last night that the ministry will not hesitate to change the opening schedule according to the changes in the morbidity rates.
HE_085	19	&quot;We have a plan formulated together with the Ministry of Health and supported by experts and professionals.
HE_085	20	We will not hesitate to change it and adapt it to the evolving reality,&quot; she said during a press conference in the special situation room set up at the Ministry of Education ahead of the start of school.
HE_085	21	&quot;This year we will mainly focus on narrowing the gaps following the last year and a half in the reading and writing studies of grades 1-2-3, preparation for matriculation of 11-12 in which we announced that we would reduce the number of exams to five matriculation exams, as well as strengthening the core studies in all levels The age,&quot; she continued.
HE_087	1	Until there is a real routine: this is how you will maintain the boundaries in front of the children
HE_087	2	Rules and boundaries are a necessary condition for the mental health of our children.
HE_087	3	But for quite a few parents, setting boundaries is not an easy challenge, all the more so during times when we all get out of the routine, like the holidays for example.
HE_087	4	The holiday season invites parents and children to leave the routine and the familiar frameworks that dictate a clear agenda (studies and kindergarten for the children, and work for the parents), as well as more time together, meetings with extended family and joint activities such as trips, vacations, and more.
HE_087	5	Many parents feel that their children &quot;get out of reset&quot; during this period, what&#39;s more, it comes right after the big holiday, which is also one big departure from routine, and find it harder for them to maintain boundaries.
HE_087	6	Have you ever asked yourself why it&#39;s hard for us to set boundaries?
HE_087	7	The reasons can be very diverse: maybe we think the child might love us less?
HE_087	8	Maybe we have trouble enforcing the laws?
HE_087	9	Maybe we grew up in a house where there were a lot of strict rules, and we decided that&#39;s not what we want to happen in our house and then do the exact opposite?
HE_087	10	Maybe because setting boundaries requires persistence and determination, which is our weakest part?
HE_087	11	Maybe we just don&#39;t know
HE_087	12	3 golden rules in setting boundaries.
HE_087	13	First and foremost, it is important to know that we set the limits for ourselves.
HE_087	14	As soon as the child speaks rudely, swears or shouts, show him that this is where your limit passes.
HE_087	15	Get up, let him or her know that you are not being spoken to like that, and leave the place.
HE_087	16	When we set the limits for ourselves, we teach our child about human dignity.
HE_087	17	Similarly, there is no need to say the same thing a thousand times.
HE_087	18	If we respect ourselves, we only say it once.
HE_087	19	So for example, if I want my child to get in the shower, I don&#39;t tell him over and over again, &quot;Well, get in the shower already.&quot;
HE_087	20	How many times do I have to ask?&quot;
HE_087	21	Instead I&#39;ll go up to him and ask: &quot;Do you turn off the TV or do I?&quot;
HE_087	22	Or I&#39;ll explain to him simply: &quot;Now come take a shower because it&#39;s very important to me that we sit together for dinner.&quot;
HE_087	23	Our child needs to meet a parent who, when he says something, also does it - such a parent can be trusted.
HE_087	24	When a parent is clear - a child is clear.
HE_087	25	When our child needs to receive medicine, we make sure to give it exactly as the doctor explained, and why?
HE_087	26	Because it is about his health.
HE_087	27	We must treat the children&#39;s education as we treat their health.
HE_087	28	If it is clear to you that things like screen time, eating sweets, sleeping hours, etc. should be limited, it will be more natural for you to mediate this to your children, explain to them the logic behind it and remain consistent until the child understands it himself.
HE_087	29	Before we leave the house with the children we will adjust expectations.
HE_087	30	That way things will be clearer and in this way we can also encourage desirable behavior.
HE_087	31	How do you do that?
HE_087	32	A preliminary conversation that will describe in simple words the plans for the day and the way you would like the day to go with the children: &quot;We are going on a trip today and I trust you that we will have a successful trip.&quot;
HE_087	33	Or: &quot;When we get to the mall we won&#39;t be able to go to Gymboree like last time, instead I&#39;ll need your help at the supermarket.&quot;
HE_087	34	Even in the car we will remind them that everyone will be responsible for their behavior, because this is our limit - we don&#39;t drive when there are shouts and fights.
HE_087	35	You can suggest that everyone in turn play the song they like, ask the child who regularly resists wearing a seat belt to be the one responsible for not moving until everyone is belted (if you give him a role, he will feel significant and less busy with resistance).
HE_087	36	When we arrived at the place, you can share with the children the amount we allocated for waste, and let them be partners in deciding what we will spend the money on.
HE_087	37	In this way we will make them feel that we trust them and consult with them.
HE_087	38	And before we want to go home, we&#39;ll give them a heads up.
HE_087	39	It is recommended to inform them fifteen minutes before returning home (&quot;Children, I need your help in getting ready to go home&quot;).
HE_087	40	When they cooperate, we will encourage them and remind them how much pleasure they make us and how much fun it is to spend time with them.
HE_087	41	Coordination of expectations with small children will be done mainly regarding safety rules.
HE_087	42	There&#39;s no need to scare them, we&#39;ll explain to them what might happen and what they should avoid (&quot;We&#39;ll soon reach a crossing, remember we don&#39;t let go?&quot;).
HE_087	43	Hufit Bahari is a parent instructor and group leader.
HE_098	1	Jewish organizations in a message to the new government: extreme measures may damage support for Israel
HE_098	2	In a difficult meeting at the Israeli embassy in Washington about two weeks ago, senior officials from several Jewish organizations in the United States warned that racist or extreme measures by the new government in Jerusalem could significantly damage support for Israel among American Jewry, according to six sources who participated in the meeting or were informed about its content.
HE_098	3	A senior Israeli official said that the meeting at the embassy represented the serious concern among the major Jewish organizations in the United States regarding a possible rift with Israel following the new government&#39;s policy towards world Jewry and democratic values.
HE_098	4	The meeting held on December 7 was attended by representatives of several organizations from the mainstream of American Jewry, which are the backbone of the pro-Israel community in the United States and are considered permanent contacts of the Israeli missions in the country.
HE_098	5	The representatives of the Jewish organizations were invited to a meeting with the head of the Diaspora Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shuli Davidovich.
HE_098	6	The latter asked to hear from them about the moods in the Jewish community regarding the political developments in Israel.
HE_098	7	The meeting took place in the middle of the coalition negotiations between the Likud and the ultra-orthodox parties and the far-right parties, and a few days after the signing of the coalition agreement that gave Knesset member Avi Maoz powers over the external educational programs in the schools.
HE_098	8	According to the sources who participated in the meeting, it took place in a difficult atmosphere and almost all the representatives of the Jewish organizations present raised concerns about the policy of the new government in Israel.
HE_098	9	Some of the concerns that were raised related to the issue of religious pluralism in Israel and the possibility that the Law of Return will be changed and severe as well as the Conversion Law, in a way that could have a negative impact on the Jewish community in the United States.
HE_098	10	Most coalition members support narrowing the Law of Return so that it will not allow the grandchildren of Jews and their spouses to obtain Israeli citizenship.
HE_098	11	Such a move could affect many Jews around the world, including in the United States.
HE_098	12	Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview with the NBC network earlier this month that he will not allow the Law of Return to be changed, but in the coalition agreements there is a clause, according to which a committee will be established to examine the issue.
HE_098	13	The Jewish leaders who participated in the meeting also raised concerns about Netanyahu&#39;s partners from the extreme right - Itamar Ben Gabir and Bezalel Smotrich - who voiced racist positions and support for Jewish supremacy, as well as about Avi Maoz - who spoke out against the rights of the LGBT community.
HE_098	14	According to sources who attended the meeting, some of the representatives of the Jewish organizations said that racist policies, moves that would harass conservative and reform Jews, and measures that would harm the LGBT community could harm donations to Israel from the Jewish community in the United States and cause young American Jews to distance themselves from Israel and not express support for it.
HE_098	15	Some of the participants in the meeting even warned of a scenario in which American Jews would organize demonstrations in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington to protest against the Israeli government or parts of it, according to four sources who were present at the meeting or were informed about its content.
HE_098	16	&quot;During the meeting there were those who said that the Jewish community in the United States might send hundreds of people on airplanes to Israel to demonstrate in Jerusalem,&quot; said one of the sources.
HE_098	17	Sources who attended the meeting said the overall message was that the new Israeli government&#39;s policies could make the work that Jewish organizations in the United States are doing to mobilize support for Israel more difficult.
HE_098	18	&quot;We told them (the people of the Israeli Foreign Ministry) that we came to warn them that things could develop in a bad direction and that they should be aware and prepare for it,&quot; said one of the participants in the meeting.
HE_098	19	The Foreign Ministry officials who participated in the meeting were surprised by the harsh messages and tried to calm the representatives of the Jewish organizations.
HE_098	20	They asked them to wait and see what the government&#39;s policy would be, and promised to convey their messages to the incoming government, according to two sources present at the meeting.
HE_098	21	Two senior officials at the Foreign Ministry said that shortly after the meeting with the representatives of the Jewish organizations, Davidovitch informed the Israeli ambassador in Washington Mike Herzog and the consuls general of Israel in the United States, who were present at the time at the conference at the Israeli embassy in Washington.
HE_098	22	Davidovich said she left the meeting with the representatives of the organizations shocked and very worried.
HE_098	23	When Davidovich returned to Israel, she updated the Foreign Ministry management on the details of the meeting with the representatives of the Jewish organizations and emphasized again that she was very worried, according to a senior official at the Foreign Ministry.
HE_098	24	Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Hait refused to comment.
HE_099	1	The Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority was recorded in the mourning tabernacle for the terrorists: &quot;The blood of the martyrs will not be in vain&quot;
HE_099	2	The Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Muhammad Eshtia, was recorded today (Sunday) during his visit to the mourning pavilion of the terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp.
HE_099	3	In a photo from the scene, the Palestinian official can be seen next to masked armed men, who wear symbols of the terrorist organizations, including the Islamic Jihad.
HE_099	4	By her wives&#39; side stands the father of the terrorist who carried out the attack on Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv, Fathi Hazem.
HE_099	5	His wife spoke during his visit and greeted the residents of Jenin.
HE_099	6	&quot;From the victims&#39; camp, the Jenin camp, we say that the blood of the martyrs and the darkness of the prisons for which our prisoners are paying will not be in vain.
HE_099	7	This struggle is a cumulative process, generation after generation, victims after victims, Jenin registered national unity on the ground,&quot; said the Palestinian official.
HE_099	8	&quot;The refugee camp is a school for Palestinian nationalism and a brother to the Shuafat refugee camp, Anata, Nablus, Rafah, the Old City of Jerusalem and all places of the Palestinian struggle.&quot;
HE_099	9	In the meantime, the readiness of the security system for the end of the Tishrei holidays reaches its peak, following the recent attacks and the riots in the capital.
HE_099	10	The security agencies are now focusing on thwarting the &quot;Lion&#39;s Den&quot; terrorist cell, which is responsible for most of the attacks in recent months.
HE_099	11	As another step, it was decided to deny the entry permits to Israel of 164 members of the families of terrorist elements in the Nablus city area, including those members of the cell.
HE_099	12	Also, TikTok blocked the accounts of some of the organization&#39;s operators and it was not possible to find content by searching the hashtag of the organization&#39;s name.
HE_099	13	However, this morning the barriers were opened.
HE_099	14	More than a week has passed since the deadly shooting attack at the Shuafat checkpoint, and the fugitive terrorist Udai Tamimi has not yet been caught.
HE_099	15	The security forces continue their search for Tamimi, and at the same time the hunt continues for the terrorist who carried out the shooting attack in Shomron captivity.
HE_099	16	While the terrorists continue to hide and the searches are focused on the neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, the incitement on the Palestinian street and on social networks continues and disturbances and attempted attacks are recorded with daily frequency, the latest of which was the shooting attack yesterday in the settlement of Beit El.
HE_099	17	In the attack on Tuesday, a 25-year-old resident of the settlement was slightly injured after being shot while sitting in the gazebo in his yard.
HE_099	18	The IDF soldiers who were active in the area shot at one of the terrorists and killed him.
HE_099	19	Yesterday morning, after a night of searching, the forces captured the second terrorist, who fled after the shooting.
HE_099	20	Weapons, uniforms and propaganda materials were found in the home of the terrorist, Muhammad Odeh, 19, from the village of Deir Jarir.
HE_099	21	The injured young man was taken to Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem.
HE_099	22	Tensions in Judea and Samaria continue with rioters continuing to throw stones at Israeli vehicles and buses.
HE_099	23	A three-year-old girl was slightly injured in the face the other day near the village of Hawara.
HE_099	24	In response, a group of settlers from the area arrived at the scene and confronted Palestinians.
HE_099	25	Military forces that arrived at the scene kept the stone throwers away and are using means to disperse demonstrations.
HE_099	26	At the same time, a bus passenger was slightly injured by stone throwing on road 436 near Jerusalem.
HE_099	27	On Route 55, between Ezon and the Ma&#39;ale Shomron intersection, an Israeli driver was also slightly injured by throwing stones.
HE_099	28	One of the main causes of unrest on the Palestinian street is the incitement against Israel on social media, which causes many of the young people to participate in particularly violent riots.
HE_099	29	The terrorist group &quot;Lions&#39; Den&quot;, which is responsible for many attacks in recent times, started its journey on Tiktok, which has become a fertile ground for serious incitement.
HE_099	30	Yesterday it was announced that the Tiktok account of the group was blocked.
HE_105	1	In the wake of the rape in the fence: residents of neighborhoods will receive donations from British Jews to establish civil guard groups
HE_105	2	Residents of neighborhoods throughout the country are preparing to set up night patrols, with the help of donations from the British Jewish community against the background of the suspicion of the serious case of rape in the fence.
HE_105	3	Dozens of residents do not wait for additional forces to reinforce the police and initiate civilian guard groups themselves to secure the area in the evening hours.
HE_105	4	Since the publication of the difficult case in the fence, citizens fear and feel exposed to possible harm.
HE_105	5	The Minister of National Security, the chairman of Otzma Yehudit Itamar Ben Gvir also pointed out during his visit to the neighborhood that the city does not have adequate personnel to respond to the residents.
HE_105	6	According to Ben Gvir, the residents who reported to him that there are only 10 police officers serving in the entire area.
HE_105	7	In a conversation with them, Ben Gabir said that it was important for him to &quot;come here, look the residents in the eyes and tell them: you are entitled to security.
HE_105	8	We have wonderful police officers who do a very, very hard job, but on the other hand, there are no budgets, no standards, no people, and my job is to provide them with that.&quot;
HE_105	9	The organization that joined the mission is JNF UK, which unites activities for Israel in the Jewish community in Great Britain.
HE_105	10	The organization says that the fundraising is being done for the purpose of the &quot;Making a Neighborhood&quot; project, which aims to connect and strengthen the residents of distressed neighborhoods and give them a better future.
HE_105	11	The organization says that &quot;only recently was a donation approved for the year 2023 to the neighborhood makers in the amount of half a million shekels, and the organization is interested in increasing support for the project&quot;, they also said &quot;We believe that the challenges in distressed neighborhoods in Israel are manifested in youth and young people wandering, increased alcohol and drug consumption, violence And the physical neglect are the best tools to grow local leaders who will lead deep social change in the neighborhood.&quot;
HE_105	12	Now the organization will ask to contribute to the establishment of such patrol groups also in underprivileged neighborhoods in Lod, Rishon Lezion, neighborhood C in Ashdod, and the Argazim neighborhood in Ashkelon.
HE_105	13	The donations will be directed to the construction of security teams, part of the salary, adapted equipment and the renovation of buildings such as shelters that will be used by the youth instead of spending time on the street.
HE_105	14	Such an initiative of voluntary security patrols in neighborhoods is already operating in several cities and their residents report a significant benefit, at least in the residents&#39; feelings.
HE_105	15	Noa, an 18-year-old girl from Ashkelon said, &quot;I didn&#39;t feel safe at night because of violence, harassment and intimidation.
HE_105	16	The night watch gave me peace of mind and protected me.
HE_105	17	I wanted to give something back, so I volunteered and took up some of my night time by walking and meeting.
HE_105	18	I want to be there for others as I appreciated that they were there for.&quot;
HE_105	19	The Rishon Lezion Magistrate&#39;s Court extended the detention of the resident of the Bedouin diaspora (22) who allegedly committed the act by nine days at noon (Sunday).
HE_105	20	The police charge the suspect with the offenses of threatening with a weapon, causing bodily harm, sodomy with abuse, pretext without free consent and breaking into a residence to commit a crime.
HE_105	21	In the arrest request, the police asked for 10 days, but Judge Gil Gabai ruled that the arrest would be extended by nine days: &quot;I found a reasonable suspicion at a high level that he committed the acts that are attributed to him.
HE_105	22	They reach a high level of dangerousness.
HE_105	23	He entered in the dead of night when the woman was staying at home with her children and committed serious sexual offenses against her under the threat of killing her.
HE_105	24	A review of the complainant&#39;s message paints a difficult picture of what she went through and the damages she suffered,&quot; the judge stated.
HE_122	1	Serious discrimination against Arabs in the cities involved in Israel
HE_122	2	In the cities involved in Israel, there is serious discrimination in the services received by the Arab residents compared to the Jewish residents - according to the state comptroller&#39;s report published today (Wednesday).
HE_122	3	According to the test, the rate of support for Arab institutions in these cities is small compared to Jewish institutions.
HE_122	4	Discrimination is also felt in the allocation of urban buildings.
HE_122	5	However, the rate of property tax collection in the Arab neighborhoods in these cities is relatively small.
HE_122	6	In addition, it appears that the number of senior Arab municipal employees is small in relation to their proportion in the population.
HE_122	7	According to the auditor&#39;s data, as of 2020, the number of residents who lived in the mixed cities is about two million.
HE_122	8	The number of Arab residents who lived in the mixed cities was 500,000, including about 370,000 in Jerusalem.
HE_122	9	A review of the main government decisions made regarding the improvement of the state of Arab society in the years 2010 to 2020, which amounted to budgets of more than NIS 19 billion, shows that with the exception of specific decisions regarding the Arab population in Jerusalem, they do not apply to the Arab residents of the mixed cities, in contrast to Arab settlements that received Dedicated budgets.
HE_122	10	The auditor mentions that the government&#39;s decisions from 2021 referred for the first time to Arab residents in mixed cities and included a budget for these cities in the amount of approximately NIS 300 million for the years 2022 to 2026.
HE_122	11	According to the auditor, the root of the problem is that the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry for Social Equality have not established a definition for the term &quot;mixed cities&quot;.
HE_122	12	From the existing definition of the CBS, it is not possible to learn about the criteria for classifying a settlement as a mixed settlement, including the number of Arab residents or their proportion.
HE_122	13	The audit showed that in all the mixed cities examined, the proportion of senior Arab employees in the municipalities is small compared to their share in the city&#39;s population: in Haifa their proportion is 7.7%, in Lod 1%, in Nof HaGilil 5%, in Akko 9%, in Tel Aviv-Jaffa 1.5% and in Ramla there are no senior Arab employees at all.
HE_122	14	In the municipalities of Lod, Nof HaGalil and Acre, it was found that, in general, the proportion of Arab workers is lower than their proportion among city residents (13%, 11% and 20% respectively).
HE_122	15	Disparities were also found in the proportion of Arabs in the composition of the employees at the municipal center in the municipalities of Lod, Nof HaGalil and Acre (6%, 11% and 6% respectively).
HE_122	16	Discrimination is also reflected in budgets from the municipality and in the allocation of municipal assets.
HE_122	17	In the audit it was found that out of 500 properties allocated by the cities involved that were tested, five properties were allocated to entities belonging to the Arab population: the Nof HaGalil and Acre municipalities did not allocate assets to entities from the Arab population, the Haifa Municipality allocated two properties, the Municipality of Lod allocated two properties and Ramle allocated one property.
HE_122	18	The Nof HaGilil municipality did not publish information regarding the allocation procedures for properties within its scope in the Arabic language newspaper, contrary to the provisions of the allocation procedure.
HE_122	19	Also, the proportion of budgets given to non-profit organizations and municipal bodies from the Arab society from the budget designated for this purpose by the municipalities of Haifa, Nof HaGalil, Acre and Ramla was less than 6%.
HE_122	20	Along with this, it was found that the property tax collection data for 2020 in some of the Arab neighborhoods in the cities of Lod, Acre and Ramla were significantly smaller than the general collection rate in those cities.
HE_122	21	In Lod, the collection rate in selected Arab neighborhoods was 35%, while the general rate was 88%.
HE_122	22	In Acre, the collection rate was 62% in selected Arab neighborhoods, compared to a general rate of 89%.
HE_122	23	In Ramla the collection rate was 26% compared to 87%.
HE_122	24	It was also found that the proportion of the remaining property tax debts for residences in the Arab neighborhoods in the cities of Lod, Acre and Ramla out of the total property tax debts for residences is significant: about 30%, 40% and 60% respectively.
HE_122	25	Comptroller Engelman recommends that the Ministry of the Interior work to clarify the binding legal situation with regard to providing adequate representation to the Arab community in the local authorities, and work to promote adequate representation for the members of the Arab population among the workers in the mixed cities.
HE_122	26	Engelman also recommends that the ministry examine additional ways to encourage their integration among the employees, and consider implementing a mechanism that will result in the central committees of these municipalities having adequate representation for the residents of the municipalities, without harming the balance established between the various factions of the council.
HE_122	27	It is also recommended that the cities involved examine steps to integrate the Arab population into their ranks, including in senior positions, as well as in the central committees operating in the city and decision-making centers.
HE_124	1	Israel is pressuring the Biden administration to remove NSO from the US Commerce Department&#39;s blacklist
HE_124	2	In recent years, the NSO company has become a strategic asset for the Israeli security establishment and especially for the Mossad, partly to promote secret ties with countries with which Israel does not have diplomatic relations or to strengthen intelligence ties with countries with which Israel has diplomatic relations.
HE_124	3	If the Biden administration decides to remove NSO from the blacklist, it will be a dramatic U-turn that is expected to draw sharp criticism within the Democratic Party, Congress and the cyber defense community in the United States.
HE_124	4	At the end of last year, after the Biden administration decided to impose sanctions on NSO, there was an internal discussion in the Israeli government regarding the extent of aid that should be given to the company and whether Israel should officially contact the American government on the issue.
HE_124	5	The heads of NSO then sent a letter to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense in which they requested their intervention and warned of the consequences of the sanctions for the future of the company.
HE_124	6	Initially, a decision was formed according to which Israel would act proactively with the United States to change the decision, but at a later stage the policy changed and Israel began to exert pressure on the Biden administration.
HE_124	7	&quot;We told the Americans that they can&#39;t destroy NSO and that even if the company had some problematic customers, that doesn&#39;t mean that the company&#39;s products and capabilities are no longer needed,&quot; an Israeli senior told Walla.
HE_124	8	Israel made it clear to the Biden administration that it should have clearly warned NSO in advance that sanctions might be imposed on them in order to give the company a chance to correct its conduct.
HE_124	9	Senior Israeli officials told their American colleagues that even now the administration must clarify what corrections the company can make in its conduct in order to get off the United States&#39; blacklist.
HE_124	10	In recent months, NSO has hired two law firms in the United States that work with the US Department of Commerce on the commodity list issue.
HE_124	11	The company&#39;s lawyers filed an appeal against the decision to blacklist NSO and asked for a hearing, but so far apart from an exchange of letters with the US Department of Commerce, there has been no progress.
HE_124	12	A senior official in the American administration confirmed in a conversation with Walla!
HE_124	13	Because Israel asked the administration to remove NSO from the blacklist, but clarified that the White House does not intend to interfere in the regulatory process of the Ministry of Commerce and the appeal filed by the company.
HE_124	14	In November 2021, the United States Department of Commerce put NSO and another Israeli offensive cyber company called Kendiro on the blacklist of companies that operate in a way that is contrary to the interest of the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
HE_124	15	This was the first time ever that the United States government imposed sanctions on Israeli cyber companies that receive an export license from the Israeli Ministry of Defense.
HE_124	16	The US Department of Commerce determined that NSO provided spies to governments that used them against journalists, human rights activists and diplomats in US embassies around the world.
HE_124	17	As part of the sanctions, any American company that wants to do business with NSO must obtain a license from the US Department of Commerce.
HE_124	18	In July 2021, a series of investigations were published in international media about the fact that a series of countries such as Hungary, India, Morocco, Mexico and Saudi Arabia used NSO&#39;s Pegasus software to spy on opposition activists and journalists.
HE_131	1	Two and a half hours after the start of the private meeting between Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at the presidential complex in Sharm el-Sheikh, the advisors of the two leaders encountered a problem.
HE_131	2	Their topics of conversation began to dwindle and hunger began to bother them.
HE_131	3	When the door opened there was hope that lunch had arrived, but it was quickly dashed when it became clear that Bennett and Essi only wanted to renew the coffee supply.
HE_131	4	In three hours of dense conversation, Bennett and al-Sisi talked about the tensions in Gaza, the relations with the Palestinian Authority, Iran and the security cooperation between Israel and Egypt.
HE_131	5	But more than all of these - the meeting dealt with their relationship.
HE_131	6	As in the first meeting with the President of the United States, Joe Biden, also in the meeting with the President of Egypt, Bennett devoted quite a bit of time to personal acquaintance.
HE_131	7	Egyptian President al-Sisi will maintain a good personal relationship with Netanyahu.
HE_131	8	He knew him and knew how to work with him.
HE_131	9	During 2020, when Israel was in a political crisis and moving between election campaigns and a dysfunctional government, Netanyahu tried several times to arrange for himself an invitation to a public visit to Egypt.
HE_131	10	His requests were repeatedly refused, after he did not agree to the Egyptian request to accompany the visit with a gesture in the Palestinian territory.
HE_131	11	In Bennett&#39;s case the situation was the opposite.
HE_131	12	The Egyptians are the ones who initiated his invitation to a public visit and did not demand any return on the Palestinian issue.
HE_131	13	The Egyptians made an unprecedented effort to externalize Bennett&#39;s visit and convey warmth.
HE_131	14	They took a long series of public gestures not seen in relations between Israel and Egypt in the last 15 years.
HE_131	15	The cold peace between Israel and Egypt seemed for a few hours hotter than ever.
HE_131	16	The Israeli side wanted to keep the exact date of the visit a secret.
HE_131	17	Both for security reasons and not to embarrass the Egyptians in the domestic arena.
HE_131	18	The Prime Minister&#39;s Office even asked to blackout the visit until Bennett&#39;s return to Israel.
HE_131	19	But Egypt had other plans.
HE_131	20	As part of the hug they gave Bennett, they made an official announcement about his visit as soon as his plane took off from Tel Aviv.
HE_131	21	When Bennett landed at the airport, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and General Intelligence Chief Abbas Kamel were waiting for him on the runway down the stairs, who escorted him to the presidential complex.
HE_131	22	In the preparatory meetings, the Israeli side asked the Egyptians only once that if there are flags in the room where the meeting will take place - they request that there be an Israeli flag as well.
HE_131	23	It may sound obvious, but the Egyptians did not place an Israeli flag in the meetings held by Al-Sisi and before Hosni Mubarak with Netanyahu.
HE_131	24	When Bennett entered the room the two flags were there side by side.
HE_131	25	The Egyptians continued the public gestures throughout the visit.
HE_131	26	They distributed photos from the meeting immediately after it began, published a detailed statement at the end and even sent a video clip from the meeting to the media in Egypt in which al-Sisi delivers a monologue in praise of relations with Israel.
HE_131	27	The Egyptian government television channels broadcast the video in the news editions.
HE_131	28	In Egypt, where there is a strong civil movement against normalization with Israel, this is no small thing.
HE_131	29	The warmth radiated by the Egyptians and the publicity of the visit are not related to Bennett but to Sisi.
HE_131	30	The Egyptian president needs Israel more than ever.
HE_131	31	Therefore, for him too, building a good relationship with the new government in Israel is critical from a political and security point of view.
HE_131	32	The Egyptians need Israeli assistance against the democratic administration in Washington on a variety of issues, the most burning of which is the conflict with Ethiopia regarding the dam that the Ethiopians are building on the Nile.
HE_131	33	For the Egyptians, this is an existential threat.
HE_131	34	But there are other reasons for the Egyptian openness.
HE_131	35	One of them is related to the calendar.
HE_131	36	A year ago this week, the ceremony took place at the White House where the &quot;Abraham Accords&quot; were signed between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
HE_131	37	The normalization between Israel and the Gulf countries and Morocco gave Sisi the political backing in the face of public opinion in his country to warm relations with Israel.
HE_131	38	The Egyptian president also saw the new page opened between Jordan and Israel immediately after Bennett took office and the political and economic gains and achievements the Jordanians received as a result.
HE_131	39	The prime minister could not have asked for a better opening to his relationship with the president of Egypt - the most important Arab country for Israel.
HE_131	40	But the meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh was only an opportunity for a first impression.
HE_131	41	Significant testing moments for the relationship will soon come.
HE_131	42	Perhaps already in the coming weeks against the background of the escalation in the Gaza Strip.
HE_138	1	Three masked men with tools in their hands broke into Kibbutz Bahna in Emek Hefer early in the morning yesterday (Monday), with the intention of breaking into houses.
HE_138	2	A quick action by the security forces in the settlement drove them away, but raised again the problems of defense along the seam line: every night, Palestinians breach the fence in dozens of locations along 970 km, from the Tarkumiya crossing to the Jalma crossing.
HE_138	3	The terrorist who carried out the shooting attack in Tel Aviv in April, penetrated the Green Line area in the Doctor&#39;s Gate area, not far from Kibbutz Baha and the Zemar local council.
HE_138	4	&quot;After the attack, the army came, closed all the loopholes in the area with a curly fence that you pull with pliers and gloves and then penetrate, really a joke,&quot; said A, a resident of the area.
HE_138	5	According to him, the IDF uncovered an area, placed large stones on the access road to the fence and brought forces to the scene.
HE_138	6	&quot;In the beginning, they deterred the Palestinians and there was a very large drop in infiltration,&quot; he added, &quot;but two months later, forces were reduced and the breaches in the fence returned again.
HE_138	7	Someone made sure to move aside the stones and the curly fence on the axis and allow access for carriers up to the fence.&quot;
HE_138	8	Permanent centers of disorder along the seam line make it difficult for the IDF forces who secure the line.
HE_138	9	One of them is the Doctor&#39;s gate.
HE_138	10	&quot;Palestinians come here almost every day and roll burning tires to burn the fence or sabotage it,&quot; said fighters in the field.
HE_138	11	Until a few weeks ago, an artillery battalion secured the seam line in the Menashe sector, between Bahah and Zemer and the Jenin district.
HE_138	12	But recently the 46th Battalion of the 401st Brigade of the Armored Corps arrived in the area, and the size of the forces decreased dramatically.
HE_138	13	&quot;There is a force that stands at a point with a tent and sleeps in the field, and one soldier who patrols alone for several kilometers,&quot; said a military official in the Menashe Brigade.
HE_138	14	&quot;Until the fighter reaches the edge of his border, the Palestinians can cross.
HE_138	15	Most of the time it happens at night and not during the day.
HE_138	16	As the observations detect an intrusion, a motorized patrol jumps to the spot.
HE_138	17	If there are several penetrations at the same time, it&#39;s a problem.&quot;
HE_138	18	According to the source, the IDF managed to develop a method of transferring information via WhatsApp to all sectors.
HE_138	19	&quot;If an agent detects a loophole, he immediately updates and patrols, or a civil contractor, run with a curly fence to close the loophole.
HE_138	20	Is it enough?
HE_138	21	of course not&quot;.
HE_138	22	The officer from the sector referred to the dug passages and breaches: &quot;We know that there is an effort to pass under the wall but factually it is difficult to pass it, there are patrols available that move along the line of the seam and can carry out pursuits, and lookouts that announce intrusions.
HE_138	23	Today, when there is no wall in large parts of the approximately 120 km in Hatmar Menashe (Jenin district) and it is easy to cross, then the tour and the observations do not really help, because there are many crossings with an emphasis on the night and turning in the morning.&quot;
HE_138	24	The officer said, in addition, that there is a significant decrease in the number of crossings, but hundreds of Palestinians still cross every week.
HE_138	25	&quot;There are dozens of breaches every week.
HE_138	26	We fixed them and then they break again.
HE_138	27	There are 23 battalions in IOS, but not all of them are involved in the security of the seam line.
HE_138	28	The majority is busy protecting the roads and settlements and arresting activity.
HE_138	29	There are three battalions in Hatmar Menashe.
HE_138	30	Most of their occupation is not the seam line at all.&quot;
HE_138	31	The fire opening instructions are one of the most sensitive issues along the seam line.
HE_138	32	While officially the IDF claims that they are clear to all commanders and soldiers, different instructions can be seen from sector to sector.
HE_138	33	In some of them, shooting at people who vandalize the fence is done with the permission of the Majad, and some only with the permission of the Brigadier General.
HE_138	34	But the main problems for the fighters arise when a Palestinian who crosses is identified as an elderly laborer with a bag of food and not as a threat.
HE_138	35	Officers a story that there was at least one case in the Maccabim Territorial Brigade (between Hetmar Ephraim and Menashe) where soldiers refused to shoot people who crossed the fence for fear of entanglement or harming Palestinians who they believed had come to look for work in Israel and not to carry out an attack.
HE_138	36	An officer in the sector said: &quot;We are aiming the shooting at fence destroyers.
HE_138	37	This is the main story.
HE_138	38	And yes, the Palestinian worker knows that he was not shot.
HE_138	39	Destroying a fence and being a terrorist is something else.&quot;
HE_138	40	The officer also said that they are not necessarily in a hurry to use shooting, but as means of dispersing demonstrations, and arresting before firing a warning shot.
HE_138	41	At the beginning of the wave of terror, the reinforcement of the Yosh and Seam Line Division reached its peak in recent years, but a few months later reservists were recruited, and the size of the regular forces was reduced to allow them to go on training.
HE_138	42	A senior security official said last night that the reinforcement of forces in IOS significantly harmed the readiness of the forces maneuvering on land for war, and therefore there is an attempt to manage risks here - they want to thwart an attack in the Israeli rear, but also speed up the pace of training.
HE_144	1	Why is Hoa Wei still allowed to operate in Israel?
HE_144	2	In July 2015, one Chinese company with a somewhat strange name - Hua Wei (known in Israel as Huawei) - was burned into the Israeli consciousness - the article in Epoch Times (issue 278, December 2015) opened about the third largest smartphone manufacturer in the world (after Samsung and Apple).
HE_144	3	But already then we reported that Hua Wei is not just an innocent telecommunications giant that wants to conquer another target - Israel.
HE_144	4	But Hua Wei has connections with the Chinese intelligence agencies, business with Iran, a communist cell in the management of the company and there is a good chance that she installs back doors in her communication equipment.
HE_144	5	Four years have passed and look what happened - on May 15 this year, the Financial Times newspaper reported that President Donald Trump issued an order prohibiting American companies from using telecommunications equipment, of any kind, manufactured by Hua Wei.
HE_144	6	The White House stated that the order actually declared a &quot;national emergency&quot; in terms of threats to American telecommunications technologies.
HE_144	7	Whereas the Reuters news agency reported that on the day the presidential order was published, the US Department of Commerce added Hua Wei and its 70 affiliates to a blacklist known as the &quot;Entity List&quot;.
HE_144	8	This means that American companies must obtain a special export license to sell American products, services and technologies to Hua Wei.
HE_144	9	&quot;Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross said that President Trump supported this decision that would prevent foreign-owned entities from using American technologies in ways that could undermine the national security of the United States or its interests in foreign policy matters,&quot; it was reported.
HE_144	10	In response to the steps of the American government, according to a news published in Bloomberg, giant companies that produce telecommunications technologies, including Intel, Qualcomm and Google announced that they are reducing their business ties with Hua Wei.
HE_144	11	Following these steps, the US asked its allies not to allow Hua Wei to participate in the construction of communication infrastructures of fifth generation technologies in their countries.
HE_144	12	Echoes of these developments have also reached us.
HE_144	13	According to a report published in &quot;Haaretz&quot;, John Rudd, the US Undersecretary of Defense, said that the US government has warned Israel of the security risk associated with the introduction of fifth generation technologies made in China for the cellular networks in Israel.
HE_144	14	Rod specifically noted that the US has identified the relationship between the Chinese government and Hua Wei as a source of risk.
HE_144	15	According to this news, Rod said that &quot;China and the Hua Wei company stole technology from American companies like T-Mobile.
HE_144	16	This is a significant source of concern due to the risk posed to our close friend like Israel if you use this type of technology [...] We are having such talks with many of our allies, such as the United Kingdom.
HE_144	17	This is not the period of the Cold War, but when trade involves things that can endanger national security - here we are concerned.&quot;
HE_144	18	But in Israel they continue to be complacent, and beyond smartphones, modems and tablets, they even extend trade with Hua Wei to the electricity production market in Israel.
HE_144	19	According to a news published in Calcalist, Hua Wei has opened a representative office in Israel that will sell equipment and maintenance services to companies that operate and build solar ground facilities for electricity production.
HE_144	20	According to this news, Hua Wei intends to contact both the entities already operating in the field and the companies competing in the Electricity Authority&#39;s tenders, which have recently started, for the establishment of solar fields.
HE_144	21	&quot;Hua Wei&#39;s participation in local electricity projects,&quot; the news said, &quot;will open a window for her to the electricity production data of the Israeli economy, such as: the ability to stream into the network in any region of Israel and understanding the working method between private electricity producers and the management of the government system that has just been established.&quot;
HE_144	22	In other words, an opening has been opened for Huai Wei to influence the production of electricity in Israel in a way that may not suit, let alone harm, the essential interests of the State of Israel.
HE_144	23	It turns out that Hua Wei announced her entry into the Israeli solar market a few hours after closing all of her solar energy businesses in the US, according to a news item published in the online newspaper The Times of Israel.
HE_144	24	According to the same news, Dan Broullette, the US Deputy Secretary of Energy Affairs who came to Israel on a business visit, warned Israel that China could use the data collected from solar panels &quot;for other things&quot;.
HE_144	25	Later he added: &quot;We continue to urge countries, not only Israel, to act carefully when dealing with countries that will use infrastructure developments to develop intelligence sources or data systems that can be used against the host countries.&quot;
HE_144	26	Despite everything said above, Israel continues to give Hua-Wei a free hand to operate.
HE_144	27	The time has come to change this, and similar to the US, to take a clear and visible position that will warn every private Israeli company that manages business relations with the Chinese company.
HE_144	28	Not only for the security of the country, but also for the benefit of Israeli hi-tech companies.
HE_155	1	Netanyahu was taken off the stage again: a rocket was intercepted during a Prime Minister&#39;s conference in Ashkelon
HE_155	2	&quot;I discovered something, which must surprise you: Hamas and Jihad do not want me to win,&quot; Netanyahu said after being allowed to return to the stage.
HE_155	3	&quot;There is nothing to do, they don&#39;t want us to win, but against their noses and their anger we will win tomorrow and in the Knesset elections.
HE_155	4	&quot;Red color when the prime minister is in Ashkelon.
HE_155	5	I&#39;m proud of Ashkelon, you won&#39;t scare us, who are you making an impression on?
HE_155	6	The one who made an impression last time is already gone and the one who will try or tried to make an impression now, who will start packing the things, he will also be sent to where he needs to be.&quot;
HE_155	7	Netanyahu also said: &quot;On behalf of the entire nation, I want to salute the IDF, the Shin Bet and the Mossad who guard us day and night.
HE_155	8	There are none better than them, and we appreciate their heroism, the heroism of the Maccabees.
HE_155	9	We are in a constant struggle, but everyone sees the trend - that the State of Israel is in the best decade in its history.&quot;
HE_155	10	The visit of Netanyahu and his wife to Ashkelon was announced in advance.
HE_155	11	Eli Gabbai, a Likud activist from Ashkelon, said: &quot;There was very loud music, we didn&#39;t hear the alarm.
HE_155	12	We only received the alert on the apps and saw the security guards evacuate Netanyahu.
HE_155	13	We heard the explosion of the hayrod.&quot;
HE_155	14	Gabay added: &quot;Bibi got off the stage quite calmly, no one ran.
HE_155	15	The mayor was with him and five minutes later he returned to the stage.
HE_155	16	None of the activists left the place.
HE_155	17	The explosion was heard while he was going to the protected area, so it didn&#39;t really matter.&quot;
HE_155	18	Peretz, Gantz and Lieberman stung Netanyahu.
HE_155	19	The Labor-Gesher party said in response to the evacuation of the prime minister following the alarm in Ashkelon: &quot;Once again the Iron Dome of Amir Peretz came to Netanyahu&#39;s aid.
HE_155	20	The truth must be told - without the iron dome that guards the Israeli home front, Netanyahu would no longer be prime minister.&quot;
HE_155	21	Chairman of Blue and White, MK Benny Gantz, said: &quot;The situation in which the citizens of Israel are at the mercy of terrorists, and the Prime Minister of Israel cannot tour a part of his country, is a certificate of poverty for the security policy in the south, and a loss of deterrence that no sovereign country can accept.
HE_155	22	&quot;We will replace the government, change the policy and restore deterrence and peace to the residents of the south.&quot;
HE_155	23	Israel Beitenu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman said: &quot;This is the second time this year that terrorist operatives in the Gaza Strip humiliate the State of Israel, and the Prime Minister once again, in the midst of an election conference, gets off the stage and flees to a protected area.
HE_155	24	The only difference is that last time it was during a speech in Ashdod - and this time in Ashkelon.
HE_155	25	&quot;Between this time and the last time, Netanyahu continued to preach and promote the series against Hamas, but the sad truth is that there was no series and there will not be a series.
HE_155	26	What there is is a surrender to terror and no amount of word washing will change the reality we have fallen into.
HE_155	27	Netanyahu, who back in 2009 promised that when he was elected he would overthrow the rule of Hamas, in the meantime is overthrowing the Israeli deterrence.&quot;
HE_155	28	In the background of these things, it should be noted that Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said in September, after the alarm in which Netanyahu was caught before he took office, that &quot;a prime minister getting off the stage in the middle of a speech because missiles are being fired at him is a national humiliation.
HE_155	29	Hamas stopped being afraid of Israel.
HE_155	30	Israel&#39;s security will be restored by the heads of Hamas being eliminated and not by press conferences.&quot;
HE_157	1	Against the background of patient complaints: growing medical cannabis off the ground was approved for the first time
HE_157	2	The Chairman of the Histadrut Pharmacists, Dodo Papa, who previously spoke out against the quality of the products allowed to be marketed by the Ministry of Health, welcomed the move, but made a reservation saying that if the cost of consumption is high - it will not be a real deal.
HE_157	3	&quot;If the final result is more accurate and clean, we will certainly welcome it.
HE_157	4	The bottom line is how much it will cost.
HE_157	5	As far as I know, crops of this kind are terribly expensive,&quot; said Lavala!
HE_157	6	NEWS.
HE_157	7	&quot;Anything that improves quality and consistency is welcome.
HE_157	8	This is very important for maintaining the therapeutic sequence.
HE_157	9	If it will be free of molds, fungi and pesticides - all the better.
HE_157	10	In the end, the quality check will determine whether the mother is her scream.
HE_157	11	We&#39;ll wait and see.&quot;
HE_157	12	Shlomi Yosef, who suffers from chronic pain since he was injured in a training accident in the army about twenty years ago, testified about the poor quality of the product today.
HE_157	13	&quot;The irradiation that is done to the plant dries the flower completely,&quot; he explained.
HE_157	14	&quot;Also the oils, everything evaporates and is destroyed.
HE_157	15	This causes a very difficult and burning smoking experience.
HE_157	16	This, in addition to the sprays that are put on the flowers, cause a reaction in the respiratory system.
HE_157	17	I myself suffered from a particulate infection in the respiratory tract - coughing attacks that lasted for many minutes and included shortness of breath.
HE_157	18	If in the end the new product is tested under &#39;boutique&#39; conditions, every flower is tested, and it will be sold at a reasonable price - of course I welcome the move.&quot;
HE_157	19	According to the CEO of Kenashor, Ran Amir, the main problem in the field of medical cannabis is the same inconsistency in the level of the products and their safety.
HE_157	20	&quot;Under different conditions of light, temperature and humidity, the plant produces different concentrations of active substances.
HE_157	21	The safety problem stems from growing conditions, which are not sufficiently controlled, to prevent the influence of pests and the development of molds.
HE_157	22	Europonic cultivation has many advantages from agricultural, environmental and commercial aspects.
HE_157	23	Cultivation on tabletops allows to increase the yield obtained for a given area.
HE_157	24	The full control over the environmental variables and the nutrition of the plant will also allow us to shorten the growing time from three months, to shorter cycles of two months, so that we can grow six cycles a year.
HE_157	25	And this is a critical matter for patients at this time, who encounter supply difficulties and the unavailability of medical cannabis.&quot;
HE_157	26	&quot;When we receive approval, we will start growing in the next few weeks&quot; The aeroponic cultivation allows for little and precise irrigation, in time cycles of one every six minutes and cultivation without spraying.
HE_157	27	In the world, aeroponic growing systems are used, mainly in cold countries, in growing vegetables, spices and green leaves.
HE_157	28	&quot;When we receive the IKR approval for commercial cultivation, and we believe this will happen in the coming weeks, the company will start growing the plant in two different cultivation systems, and will compare them to find which one is more effective, among other things, in terms of reducing the use of resources and increasing the yield for a given area.&quot;
HE_157	29	The Ministry of Health stated that it has been working to improve the quality of the product for several years, and that it is nearing the end of this process.
HE_157	30	&quot;As a general rule, any cultivation method is acceptable, provided that it is in accordance with the &#39;Growing under appropriate conditions of cannabis for medical use IMC-GAP&#39; guidelines, which are intended to ensure that the quality of the product will be in accordance with the required parameters, including the amount and concentration of active substances, foreign substances, pesticides, heavy metals , microbial factors, toxins, and other tests, and that the cannabis products that reach medical use will be of high quality, tested and properly known as a product for medical use.&quot;
HE_165	1	A judge criticized &quot;Migdal&quot;: it tried to evade responsibility
HE_165	2	A delivery driver of the &quot;Karvitz&quot; company was injured when he was unloading goods.
HE_165	3	In order to avoid paying compensation, her insurer claimed that it was a car accident and not a work accident.
HE_165	4	The Tel Aviv Magistrate&#39;s Court recently rejected the Kravitz company and its insurance company Migdal, who sought to avoid paying compensation for the injury of a delivery driver who jumped from a truck while unloading goods: Judge Menachem (Mario) Klein ruled that this was a work accident, and rejected the attempt of &quot;Migdal&quot; to evade responsibility while stretching the limit of the definition of the law &quot;beyond common sense&quot;.
HE_165	5	In June 2015, a delivery driver of &quot;Krabitz&quot; stopped at the &quot;Big&quot; complex in Beit Shemesh to unload goods.
HE_165	6	While he was moving pallets of goods to the ramp, it apparently went out of balance and a cart with a heavy pallet started rolling towards him.
HE_165	7	In an attempt to escape from her, he jumped from the truck and seriously injured his legs.
HE_165	8	In response to the tort claim he filed against his employer and its insurance company Migdal, the two replied that it was not a work accident at all.
HE_165	9	According to them, the claimant was injured in a car accident, since he got off the truck while he was engaged in activities whose ultimate goal is to continue transporting goods using the truck, in its role as a transport vehicle.
HE_165	10	The plaintiff argued on the other hand that an accident that occurs while unloading a parked truck is not considered a traffic accident according to the law.
HE_165	11	According to him, this is a work accident that happened due to the negligence of Kravitz, who did not provide him with a safe working environment and adequate precautions, did not instruct him properly, did not inform him of the maximum weight that can be loaded on the ramp, and did not supervise his work.
HE_165	12	Judge Menachem (Mario) Klein noted that the accident happened while the engine was off, when the vehicle was parked in the suppliers&#39; parking lot and the plaintiff was unloading the goods that were loaded onto it.
HE_165	13	Given that, even though the truck also has a transportation use, the injury occurred when it was used as an &quot;accident scene&quot; and not as a transport vehicle.
HE_165	14	Accordingly, it was determined that the plaintiff was right and that it was a work accident and not a car accident, and the judge criticized the argument presented on behalf of &quot;Karvitz&quot; and &quot;Migdal&quot;.
HE_165	15	He pointed out that the compensation law for victims of car accidents is a social law and therefore the courts have often had to be flexible with the definition of &quot;car accident&quot; in order to benefit the plaintiffs - the victims.
HE_165	16	&quot;And here in the case before me, &#39;the formations have reversed&#39; - the plaintiff seeks to sue in accordance with the grounds of the ordinance and the insurer of the &#39;injurer&#39; clings to the Law of the Palestinian Authority, as a reason to avoid tortious liability.
HE_165	17	I believe that in such situations there is no place to &#39;stretch&#39; the rope of the definition of &#39;traffic accident&#39; in the law beyond common sense,&quot; he wrote in the ruling.
HE_165	18	Therefore, the claim of &quot;Kravitz&quot; and &quot;Migdal&quot; was rejected and they were charged with expenses of NIS 5,000 regardless of the results of the procedure, which will continue to be conducted on the issue of liability and damage.
HE_165	19	The two filed third-party notices against the leasing company that leased the truck to Kravitz, which filed a fourth-party notice against the locksmith that built the ramp.
HE_165	20	Since the two joined the claim that it was a car accident, they were also ordered to pay the plaintiff expenses of NIS 5,000 each.
HE_177	1	A pilot rehabilitation of minors from imprisonment and detention began yesterday
HE_177	2	The Ministry of Justice announced that a pilot for the rehabilitation of minors from imprisonment and detention has begun, which is an implementation of a government decision from 2018, regarding the &quot;adoption of the report of the inter-ministerial team for examining the release of minors from imprisonment&quot;.
HE_177	3	The basis of the pilot is a concept of continuous work from the moment a minor is arrested, due to suspicion of committing a criminal offense, until his release from the prison he served after being convicted of a crime, emphasizing the importance of each step in the sequence, and the role of each body in the given step.
HE_177	4	The committee was established by the previous Minister of Justice, Ayelet Shaked, for the purpose of examining the issue of the release and rehabilitation of minors in prison, and was chaired by the inter-ministerial coordinator for the prevention of juvenile delinquency in consultation and legislation, advocate Michal Gold.
HE_177	5	The team was established in view of the high rate of recidivism of juveniles returning to prison.
HE_177	6	As mentioned, the government adopted the team&#39;s recommendations and established a steering committee that will determine which of the report&#39;s recommendations can be implemented immediately, and will recommend implementation methods for the rest of the report&#39;s recommendations.
HE_177	7	In order to promote the recommendations agreed upon by the various bodies and to examine the proposed work model, it was agreed to embark on an inter-ministerial pilot, where attorney Neta Fat, who has extensive legal background in the field of youth, was appointed as the project manager, subordinate to the inter-ministerial coordinator for the prevention of youth delinquency .
HE_177	8	As part of the pilot, in the first phase there will be coordination between the probation service, the prison service and the Prisoner Rehabilitation Authority, so that the minor will be continuously accompanied by care providers from the day of his arrest until after his release from prison.
HE_177	9	During the arrest phase, the probation officers designated for the pilot will include the procedure in which the minor is in, data will be collected concerning the minor&#39;s life and past (for example information from education, welfare, local authority frameworks) and will build a treatment plan that matches his needs.
HE_177	10	This, in the framework of round table discussions in which all the relevant parties will take part - which will be held in prison, with the participation of the minor, his family members or another benefactor, welfare officials, representatives of the local government, the youth sponsor and anyone who can contribute to a therapeutic dialogue with the aim of finding a suitable alternative to detention for the minor his needs.
HE_177	11	In the second stage, and as the minor is sentenced to prison, the representative of the Prisoner Rehabilitation Authority will build for him and with his participation a plan for release from prison that will respond to his needs and desires.
HE_177	12	The rehabilitation program is not limited to minors who are released on early release, but will be built for all minors who are interested and suitable for it, in order to allow them a gradual and controlled return to society, either on early release or after serving a full prison term.
HE_177	13	As part of the pilot, parole board hearings will be held in the format of a re-entry court, based on a &quot;problem-solving court&quot; model and aimed at holding a dialogue between the parties to the process, in order to examine needs and concerns that arise from the behavior and conduct of the minor in prison, and with the aim of building an optimal plan for him that matches his needs.
HE_177	14	It will be emphasized that this is a first step and that as part of the process there will be constant thinking, the necessary adjustments will be examined and lessons learned, with the aim of optimizing the procedure and adapting it to the needs arising from the field.
HE_177	15	Also, in the course of time and as needed, legislative proposals will be presented, which will be presented as usual, before the approving ranks.
HE_177	16	The pilot will be accompanied by an inter-ministerial committee, led by the inter-ministerial coordinator for the prevention of juvenile delinquency, which will monitor the implementation of the recommendations, discuss broad issues that arise from the field and resolve disputes as they arise in the teams.
HE_177	17	Deputy Attorney General (Criminal Law), Attorney Amit Marari: &quot;The pilot is an important link within a large-scale process in recent years, to promote holistic thinking in the field of law enforcement, all with the understanding that more creative and precise solutions are required to deal with crime phenomena.
HE_177	18	In this framework, there is now an understanding that a combination of hands is required between the enforcement, welfare and treatment factors, and an emphasis is placed on prevention, rehabilitation and long-term solutions to reduce the return to crime.
HE_177	19	I would like to thank all the partners who take part in the pilot and are mobilized for its success.&quot;
HE_177	20	The head of the inter-ministerial coordinator for the prevention of juvenile delinquency, Adv. Livnat Melamed: &quot;During the thought process in the steering and implementation teams, the need for cooperation between all the ministries concerned in the field of youth breaking the law was clarified, and the mobilization of all those involved to take part in the process and join hands was recorded.
HE_177	21	This is a process that we consider &#39;thinking outside the box&#39;, after sharing and learning with passing youth, in order to learn needs and concerns.
HE_177	22	The purpose of the pilot is to touch the life of every minor prisoner and be an accurate answer to his needs and the circles that surround him.
HE_177	23	I hope that, in time, we can look back, see a positive change in trend, and feel that the process is so natural for all of us.&quot;
HE_177	24	The former Minister of Justice, MK Ayelet Shaked, commented on the implementation of the pilot and said that &quot;Imprisonment should be the last alternative which the court uses only when there is no other choice, certainly when it comes to teenagers whose rehabilitation potential is high.
HE_177	25	Our responsibility towards children and teenagers must also find its expression in dealing more effectively with those whose fate has not improved for them.
HE_177	26	Every single soul that we saved from crime and brought back from the fringes to the king&#39;s way is a full world.
HE_177	27	Prevention and early treatment are better than punishment and the use of criminal tools.&quot;
HE_180	1	The people who opened a new business just now
HE_180	2	&quot;I moved from Tel Aviv to Be&#39;er Sheva in 2011, after the social protest.
HE_180	3	As a singer and musician I plowed the country with concerts, so I got to know the city.
HE_180	4	I liked the people and wanted to mix in the music scene here.
HE_180	5	But after three years I lost my voice due to a cruel wart on the strings, and I could not perform.
HE_180	6	I turned the whole city upside down and couldn&#39;t find a place where I could bartend or serve, and where I would feel comfortable.
HE_180	7	Something about Beer Sheva&#39;s entertainment culture didn&#39;t suit me, because most of it is based on luxury and abundance.
HE_180	8	So I opened a bar myself.
HE_180	9	I didn&#39;t even give it a name, just a small neighborhood bar.
HE_180	10	And it was really cool.
HE_180	11	A few months ago, after much talk and deliberation, I decided to expand into the food sector.
HE_180	12	Because my bar is great, but there is nothing to eat except peanuts.
HE_180	13	Then all of a sudden all sorts of things worked out: the space next to the bar became vacant, and a beloved cook, a friend of my friends, returned to Beer Sheva after years in Tel Aviv.
HE_180	14	So I decided to expand and we started renovations in December.&quot;
HE_180	15	Then came the corona virus.
HE_180	16	&quot;I ate it from all directions with this corona.
HE_180	17	We finished the renovation of the place on March 10, when I was already suffocated by loans.
HE_180	18	We planned to do a run to the place for a few weeks, then on March 14 the world exploded.
HE_180	19	We fell into the market.
HE_180	20	We hung out in houses for a month, after which we tried to sell sandwiches at lunchtime to offices in the neighborhood, even though that&#39;s very much not us - we&#39;re night people.
HE_180	21	At the end of May, when it was possible to open restaurants, we started from scratch again.
HE_180	22	I got to the point where I had no idea what was going on, I didn&#39;t even know what I was opening, a bar-restaurant or a sandwich shop.&quot;
HE_180	23	As a musician you are screwed twice because the shows were also canceled.
HE_180	24	&quot;Right.
HE_180	25	I went down to zero in one day.
HE_180	26	It was a time of panic, you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting money from.
HE_180	27	I burned through my savings, got help from my parents, and luckily my partner, who is a physical therapist, was working most of the time so we had some power at home.
HE_180	28	The state grant also pleasantly surprised me and arrived right on time.&quot;
HE_180	29	How did you get out of Baruch?
HE_180	30	&quot;I used the lockdown for homework and getting organized.
HE_180	31	I learned a lot about wine and connected with local farms in the south.
HE_180	32	The bar returned to normal activity immediately after the closure, because it has a cohesive community and people missed it.
HE_180	33	The new place needs more time.
HE_180	34	It&#39;s still far from profitable, but it&#39;s only been a month and things are getting better day by day.
HE_180	35	We worked every night according to the rules with alcohol gel and a thermometer, and people came.
HE_180	36	We came close to breaking even and I was really optimistic.&quot;
HE_180	37	Then this week they closed all the bars again.
HE_180	38	&quot;I have no idea what will happen.
HE_180	39	It is complex because every evening we update and learn from day to day.
HE_180	40	Whatever they ask, I will do.
HE_180	41	I just want to get along.
HE_180	42	I no longer have the strength in my body to protest.
HE_180	43	All that&#39;s left is to finish all the beers and get drunk, after all we opened the kegs and no one will drink them soon anyway.&quot;
HE_180	44	Do you regret opening?
HE_180	45	&quot;In a way yes, because I feel that as I&#39;ve expanded, I&#39;ve become more vulnerable and I prefer small things.
HE_180	46	I don&#39;t have the ego of a businessman, and I think that the next generation of businessmen after the corona virus should be taught a lesson in modesty.
HE_180	47	What&#39;s amazing is that everywhere here in the city I see the landlord behind the counter.&quot;
HE_180	48	So why are you here anyway?
HE_180	49	&quot;There are more than 200 thousand people in this city.
HE_180	50	I believe the situation will work out.
HE_180	51	At the end of the day, I prefer to see if I&#39;m healthy, happy and surrounded by friends, and only then count the cash.
HE_180	52	That&#39;s the only way to persevere, and in businesses like this, persistence is the key, not the type of vodka on the menu.&quot;
HE_180	53	&quot;For the past four years, I have operated a company for service carts (coffee, jacuzzi and toilets), which I rent for events in Israel and abroad, mainly in the United States.
HE_180	54	But the corona virus closed my business and in one week the whole schedule for the year ahead was cancelled.
HE_180	55	I had no choice.
HE_180	56	At the age of 50 I will not go to work in construction.
HE_180	57	So I thought what I could do and decided to go to a spa.
HE_180	58	I rented a yard in the Drakhi Hashem district in Mitzpe Ramon.
HE_180	59	Except for one pub, there are no attractions in the area to go out in the evening.
HE_180	60	Out of this need, I opened the place.&quot;
HE_180	61	Where did you get the money for that?
HE_180	62	&quot;Even before the business opened, I went among friends and sold tickets for entrances in advance, and accumulated a good amount.
HE_180	63	That&#39;s how I got my first investment, which wasn&#39;t that big anyway.
HE_180	64	I already had a jacuzzi from the strollers, which I invested a lot of money in a year ago.
HE_180	65	And the sauna was mainly an investment of work, so I built it myself, and thus I saved.
HE_180	66	I am the only employee in the business and do everything myself.
HE_180	67	Besides, the owner of the place does not charge me rent, only a percentage of the profits.
HE_180	68	Photography: Tomi Harpaz.
HE_180	69	&quot;After all, the idea of ​​establishing a spa has been in my head for a long time.
HE_180	70	Already 20 years ago I submitted a business plan to the council, but they waved me off, it didn&#39;t interest them at all.
HE_180	71	The corona finally put it into practice.&quot;
HE_180	72	So the corona has made your dream come true.
HE_180	73	&quot;it has got something in it.
HE_180	74	But there is also a lot of constraint here.
HE_180	75	All the tourism people in Mitzvah renewed themselves in something and made the businesses more oriented towards domestic tourism.&quot;
HE_180	76	Are there any advantages in opening a business precisely at such a time?
HE_180	77	&quot;A lot of people are stuck in the country, and it&#39;s summer now.
HE_180	78	The hotels are really in trouble, but in the world of attractions it&#39;s a little different.
HE_180	79	I opened the business two and a half weeks ago and in the meantime I am full.
HE_180	80	One of the advantages is that it is a private spa.
HE_180	81	You book the place for yourself and you are the only customer there, no one enters in the process.
HE_180	82	The spa is also thoroughly disinfected between customers, so for Corona it turned out really well.&quot;
HE_181	1	Paralyzed attorney: Let me pray in the Cave of the Patriarchs in an appeal to the head of the Civil Administration Attorney Roash, who is 100 percent disabled, requests to make the Cave of the Patriarchs accessible to the disabled: don&#39;t cut me off from my roots.
HE_181	2	Attorney Avraham Roash, a 100 percent disabled person dealing with cerebral palsy and who moves with the help of a motorized wheelchair, appeals to the head of the Civil Administration, Brigadier General Rasan Alian, with a call to make the Machpela cave accessible to those with special needs who cannot currently enter the cave and pray there.
HE_181	3	We will remind you that after quite a few discussions on the issue, the Minister of Defense, Benny Gantz, ordered to open procedures to make the Cave of the Patriarchs accessible to those with special needs, however, the Civil Administration decided to delay the implementation of the directive and allow submission of objections to the project for 21 days.
HE_181	4	In an interview with Channel 7, Attorney Roach tells about his request submitted under the title &#39;Humanitarian approval for access to the Cave of the Patriarchs&#39;: &quot;Currently there is no access.
HE_181	5	This project is designed to allow people with disabilities to properly reach the graves of the ancestors.
HE_181	6	For us it is more than a nuisance.
HE_181	7	This is our connection to Israel&#39;s heritage.
HE_181	8	When the place is not accessible to people with disabilities, there is a hidden statement here that disconnects us from our Jewish roots and belonging to the entire Jewish heritage.&quot;
HE_181	9	Regarding the motive that has so far delayed the accessibility project, he says that &quot;in the law there is a possibility to exempt sites from accessibility for sites that are designated as designated for preservation.
HE_181	10	The administration does not want to get into the vortex of political debates and decided to use the section that grants an exemption to places like the Cave of the Patriarchs, although in my opinion the cave should be excluded from this section because it is a house of worship that is much more than a site for archaeological preservation.
HE_181	11	As a house of prayer, it is designed to allow a person to connect with his roots.
HE_181	12	If we don&#39;t make the cave accessible, we will drive entire populations away from the site.&quot;
HE_181	13	In his letter to Tal Alian, Attorney Roash writes: Harini came to his honor with a request that he retract the decision not to approve access to the Cave of the Patriarchs (hereinafter: &quot;the decision&quot;).
HE_181	14	I, Avraham Roach, born in 1977, am a person dealing with cerebral palsy and as a result uses a motorized wheelchair.
HE_181	15	The decision not to make the Cave of the Patriarchs accessible hurts me and my disabled friends whose religious way of life gives a visit to the Cave of the Patriarchs an empowering spiritual meaning.
HE_181	16	This spiritual meaning is so great and much more powerful for me than the conversation with the psychologist, than the conversation with the rabbi.
HE_181	17	Not only do I not feel like an equal among equals since the decision was made not to make the cave accessible, but I also feel that even this little pastime has encountered difficulties with bureaucrats who deny me the legitimate right to reach the cave as a person and not on the shoulders of our dear soldiers as if I were them at the end of a beret route and journey .
HE_181	18	True, I know that permits and exemptions can be found to make the cave accessible due to it being an archaeological structure intended for engineering preservation (form 37), as well as due to various political claims.
HE_181	19	But it seems that the Cave of the Patriarchs should be excluded from any other archaeological site.
HE_181	20	It seems that the segregation of the disabled from the Cave of the Patriarchs is like our displacement, of people with disabilities, from the Jewish roots, from the place where the identity of the Jewish nation was formed.
HE_181	21	Some may say that I am exaggerating with this comparison, but as a religious person I feel the lack every time I give up visiting the graves of the martyrs, thinking that I do not want to be in a situation where many people are holding me, my clothes or the means of help I have with me.
HE_181	22	I ask for the right to pray in the cave like any other person, I generally ask to pray with dignity.
HE_181	23	Please accept my request.
HE_181	24	I would like to point out that this request is submitted on my own behalf, but I am here for many people like me, by the way, also from the Muslim and Christian side, whose desire is the same.
HE_181	25	to pray with respect
HE_181	26	I again appeal to his honor to think twice and understand that the solution to accessibility is not political but humanitarian.
HE_181	27	The administration must find a way to help everyone of all religions and nationalities.
HE_181	28	The Spokesperson of the Civil Administration responded: Following the directive of the Minister of Defense, on 04.08.20 (Tuesday) the sub-committee for planning and licensing in the Civil Administration met to discuss the request for a building permit in order to promote the project of making the Cave of the Patriarchs accessible.
HE_181	29	At the request of the presenters of the proposals, the professional materials that were before the planning and licensing sub-committee will be forwarded to them for their review, and they were also given the opportunity to submit their written comments to the committee within 21 days.
HE_181	30	After that, the final decision will be made by the committee.
HE_183	1	Despite the awakening in the market: the Finance Committee wants to extend the purchase tax exemption for housing improvers 17:22 Amitai Gazit
HE_183	2	The Finance Committee will discuss tomorrow (Tuesday) a temporary order that will allow for the second time this year to extend the period during which housing developers enjoy a partial exemption from purchase tax, a benefit worth tens of thousands of shekels - Calcalist has learned.
HE_183	3	This refers to thousands of Israelis who have purchased a new apartment, are living in it, and have not yet sold their previous apartment.
HE_183	4	If in the first closure the reasoning for extending the period was stagnation in the real estate market due to technical difficulties in making transactions, now the data shows that the market has woken up, the number of transactions for the purchase of an apartment is soaring and housing prices are not falling - so there is no good explanation for this step, which will encourage housing developers to keep their old apartment Looking at price increases, a phenomenon that will lead to a reduction in the inventory of apartments for sale.
HE_183	5	Starting in 2016, housing improvers must sell the previous apartment within 18 months from the date of buying the new apartment, otherwise they are charged a tax that reaches tens and even hundreds of thousands of shekels.
HE_183	6	Following the corona crisis and claims that during the first lockdown period it was difficult to conduct transactions, the Knesset approved in July of this year a 7-month extension to the exemption period.
HE_183	7	So those for whom this period ended between March and October 2020 will receive an extension of 7 additional months.
HE_183	8	Tomorrow, as mentioned, the finance committee will ask to extend the attack granting exemption until June 2021.
HE_183	9	This is a huge benefit: housing improvers who sell their previous apartment in time pay tax as if they had purchased their first apartment, so the rate is only 0-5% of the price of the apartment; On the other hand, if they did not sell the apartment within 18 months plus the extension granted by the Knesset, they are required to pay a tax at a rate of 5-10% of the price of the apartment.
HE_183	10	For the sake of illustration, for the purchase of an apartment at a price of 2 million shekels, the owner of a single apartment (or a housing developer who sold his apartment within a year and a half) will pay a tax of only 8,942 shekels, less than half a percent; On the other hand, if this is not his only apartment, he will pay a purchase tax of NIS 160,000 (8%).
HE_183	11	The previous Minister of Finance, Moshe Kahlon, was the one who shortened the exemption period from 24 months to 18, in order to encourage the sale of apartments and increase the supply.
HE_183	12	In other words, the finance committee is leading to us going back a step or maybe even a step and a half back - and it is not at all clear what the justification for this is.
HE_183	13	According to the chief economist at the Ministry of Finance, Shira Greenberg, the average salary of housing improvers is NIS 32,000 per month, and the average price of an apartment they purchase is NIS 2.2 million.
HE_183	14	A review by the chief economist also shows that in August of this year, 10,500 transactions were registered, the second highest figure for the month of August in 20 years.
HE_183	15	In September, 9,600 transactions were made.
HE_183	16	In other words, it is impossible to claim that there is a stagnation in the real estate market, since transactions are carried out - and a lot.
HE_183	17	Thus, the only logical reason for housing developers to continue to own their old apartment is an unwillingness to compromise on its price.
HE_183	18	When the state gives them such a generous benefit, they have no reason to rush.
HE_190	1	I saw an upside down world Rabbi Tal Chaimovich
HE_190	2	When Rabbi Yosef son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi recovered from his illness, his father asked him what he saw in the legal worlds up there.
HE_190	3	Rabbi Yosef said to him, I saw an upside-down world: upper ones below and lower ones above.
HE_190	4	To this his father answered him, that precisely there is the clear world, while here the reality is the opposite (Pesachim 9:11).
HE_190	5	I remembered this Sage article when I heard about the High Court ruling against Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu, when in fact this ruling comes against every rabbi in Israel.
HE_190	6	What is the claim against the rabbi?
HE_190	7	In that he expresses himself on issues that are not related to the fulfillment of his duties as the High Court sees it and not in a literal way, and again, according to the High Court&#39;s view.
HE_190	8	It is very strange, that the Supreme Court&#39;s entire ability to rule is based on the Israeli law book; and for a long time he himself shapes his role according to his own vision and tramples every law with a rough foot; tells the rabbi that his role is defined according to the Torah only, that he deviates from the law.
HE_190	9	Whose law exactly?!
HE_190	10	The Torah writes about the judges: You shall not live in front of anyone, for the judgment belongs to God (Deuteronomy 1:17).
HE_190	11	The meaning of this verse is that the judge must see before his eyes only the divine instructions, and not be afraid of any authority when he comes to judge.
HE_190	12	More than that, since the judgment is God&#39;s, the rabbi who carries the flag of the Torah does not have to consider any reality or external factor that opposes the ruling.
HE_190	13	It is the Torah that in its words carves out reality exactly as it was done in the creation of the world, and not the other way around.
HE_190	14	The Torah is the order of the world that is prepared according to the gnosis plan in it (Bereishit Rabbah 1:1), and the world cannot rise against it, just as matter cannot rise against its creator.
HE_190	15	This spiritual meaning also has halachic implications.
HE_190	16	A rabbi should surrender his soul and not say a halachic ruling that is not true, even if it is out of fear of danger (Maharshal, in B.K. P. D. C. 9).
HE_190	17	This pretension to determine the role of the rabbi goes against everything that has been handed down to us over the generations.
HE_190	18	The role of a rabbi is not only to pronounce Halacha, but to shape a spiritual reality in his words, in every field and field, and for every person who has the ability to influence him to do better.
HE_190	19	Woe to the rabbi who will become a gray clerk who provides a chronological index.
HE_190	20	The role of the rabbi can be learned from what Rabbi Emi and Rabbi Esi sang in the presence of.
HE_190	21	The Gemara in Tractate Ketubut (17 11), relates that when they appointed them as rabbis over their community, they sang to them (translation): Rabbis like these you shall appoint to us, and you shall not appoint to us either the castrators, or the rags.
HE_190	22	The &#39;Greatest of Minsk&#39; (Shabibi Or, p. Med) explained that there are two well-known &#39;rabbinic&#39; problems here.
HE_190	23	One that tries to threaten the rabbis so that they change their rulings.
HE_190	24	A rabbi who gives in to threats is one of the falsifiers of Halacha.
HE_190	25	But there is another rabbi who is one of the rags.
HE_190	26	What does that mean?
HE_190	27	The rag was used in ancient times as a common cork.
HE_190	28	Was there a hole somewhere?
HE_190	29	Stick a rag in and come to Zion Goel.
HE_190	30	A rabbi who is like a rag is nothing more than a cork that is pushed where it is wanted.
HE_190	31	Who decides what his role is?
HE_190	32	the hole
HE_190	33	Such a rabbi is exalted in his position, clear and smooth! A rabbi should be like a high priest who is responsible for the spiritual functioning of the members of his community, not just a halachic arbiter on well-known questions (Hats, Och Kanach).
HE_190	34	We are blessed to have guiding rabbis and public leaders like the genius Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu who walks without fear or dread.
HE_190	35	&quot;All kinds of justice are entrusted to us, neither from Sarmisin nor from rags&quot;!
HE_190	36	The author is Rabbi Tal Haimovich, head and founder of the Rabnan Dagda Institute
HE_194	1	The Law of Regulatory Arrangements is close to a compromise.
HE_194	2	The issue of the retirement age for women is still at an impasse. Knesset members are waging a continuous struggle ahead of the vote on the Settlements Law tomorrow.
HE_194	3	MK Mossi Raz of Meretz: &quot;I fear that the authority as it looks today will turn into another bureaucratic body that costs the government 70 million shekels a year&quot;
HE_194	4	&quot;Take a meter, measure the distance between you and end the negotiations in the middle,&quot; said Finance Minister Avigdor Lieberman today (Wednesday) to the participants of the negotiating team trying to reach an agreement regarding the regulatory reform.
HE_194	5	This is in preparation for the vote on the settlement law tomorrow at noon.
HE_194	6	The negotiations on the subject, which lasted nine and a half hours yesterday, and continues today, are led by the Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister&#39;s Office, Abir Kara, who is interested in passing the law as it is currently drafted.
HE_194	7	On the other hand, MK Mossi Raz from Meretz leads a group of MKs and ministers who are interested in changing the law, including members of Knesset Michal Rosin (Meretz), Alon Tal and Eitan Ginzburg from Blue and White and Ram Shefa from Mish Atid who also took part in the negotiations.
HE_194	8	The fight is no longer focused on the text of the Settlements Law that was placed on the Knesset table yesterday, but on the statements that Lieberman will make for the minutes, in the Knesset Plenum, when he presents the budget tomorrow, in which he will declare about the changes that will be made to the Settlements Law.
HE_194	9	One of the apparent agreements between the parties is that the Authority for Oversight of Regulation when it is established will not be able to disqualify decisions of ministers or government officials and such disqualification can only be carried out by the government or a committee of ministers authorized to do so.
HE_194	10	MK Abir Kara, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister&#39;s Office and founder of the union &quot;Ani Shulman&quot; Ofer Vakanin.
HE_194	11	In addition, disqualification of a regulatory decision will be based on the way in which the decision was made and not because of its content.
HE_194	12	Another agreement is that in the event of an emergency, the ministers will be authorized to exclude their decisions from the regulatory authority&#39;s authority for at least two years.
HE_194	13	Another agreement relates to the definition of the goals of the reform and the authority to regulate, beyond the need for economic efficiency, concern for the environment, as well as safety and public health, will be added.
HE_194	14	Among the issues that the parties have not yet agreed on is the cumulative amount of time in which the regulatory authority can delay a decision by a minister in the government.
HE_194	15	In total, according to the current version of the reform, it reaches nine months.
HE_194	16	Regarding the composition of the regulatory authority plenum, the parties have already reached an agreement that among the six members of the plenum, which currently consists of economic and legal factors, a representative with an orientation to the field of health and the environment will also be included.
HE_194	17	The group of MKs opposing the reform demands that it be more than one representative.
HE_194	18	A third issue that is not agreed upon is the economic scope of a decision that the Authority can reject.
HE_194	19	The scope defined in the reform now is a decision whose economic consequences are higher than NIS 100 million.
HE_194	20	&quot;It may sound like a lot, but it&#39;s a small amount.
HE_194	21	For the purpose of the example, if a mask is found that can protect the citizens of Israel from corona and the cost is 4 shekels per day, the economic cost will already be 130 million shekels per year.
HE_194	22	I demand that the amount that can be disqualified increases to more than a billion shekels per year.
HE_194	23	I am also in favor of permission for regulation.
HE_194	24	The question is what authority will be given to her.
HE_194	25	I am afraid that the authority as it looks today will turn into another bureaucratic body that costs the government 70 million shekels a year,&quot; MK Raz said in a conversation with him.
HE_194	26	&quot;The gaps have not changed&quot; While in the field of regulatory reform it is possible to mark the progress of the parties towards a compromise, when it comes to raising the retirement age for women the parties are at an impasse.
HE_194	27	Although in this matter too the negotiation continues around the clock.
HE_194	28	According to MK Michal Rosin, &quot;the differences between us have not changed.
HE_194	29	There are two points on which we will not give up: providing unemployment benefits for a period of more than a year to 57-year-old girls who have dropped out of the labor market, providing a negative income tax or, in other words, a job grant up to a salary of NIS 6,000 a month.
HE_194	30	We have agreed so far that each woman will receive an additional NIS 500 per month in this framework.
HE_194	31	It is a fine of NIS 1,500 for women whose right to an old-age pension of NIS 2,000 at the age of 62 was revoked.
HE_194	32	An allowance that allows kindergarten assistants or cleaning workers to lower their job percentages a little at this age.&quot;
HE_194	33	Rosin also added: &quot;An issue that we have made progress on is solving the problem of underutilization of the negative income tax benefit among women who speak Amharic, Arabic and Russian.
HE_194	34	It&#39;s funny to say, but I&#39;m fighting here for Lieberman&#39;s electorate.
HE_194	35	These women do not exhaust their rights in National Insurance.
HE_194	36	In the discussions, we have currently reached an agreement on a course of automation of the process so that those entitled to these grants will not have to submit forms to receive them.&quot;
HE_194	37	MK Naama Lazimi (Labor) also commented on the issue: &quot;Lieberman says we have made progress in the negotiations and I don&#39;t understand what he is talking about.
HE_194	38	Next to the issue of the job grant there is the issue of older women who go for employment training.
HE_194	39	In the current situation, when they take her out for training, she will not be able to survive on the NIS 2,500 she receives as an allowance.
HE_194	40	It&#39;s a joke, it&#39;s an intensive course.
HE_194	41	There is also the issue of unemployment benefits. There is a question of how to treat a 60-year-old woman who has been thrown into the labor market.
HE_194	42	Their occupational vulnerability is different and eligibility for unemployment only if they have worked for one year out of the last year and a half - problematic.
HE_194	43	Even so, we took a few steps towards the treasury and we do not compromise.
HE_194	44	As far as I&#39;m concerned, the deficit will increase or a framework will be breached.
HE_194	45	If maintaining the framework is based on not giving money to poor women, we are in trouble.&quot;
HE_194	46	Lazimi is leading the fight against the plan to raise the retirement age.
HE_200	1	36 rockets were fired throughout the night into the Gaza Strip; The IDF announced a return to normalcy
HE_200	2	36 rockets were fired tonight (Saturday) from the Gaza Strip towards settlements surrounding Gaza.
HE_200	3	The Iron Dome system intercepted four of them and the rest landed in open areas.
HE_200	4	The IDF announced this morning that it is possible to return to normal, this after last night instructing the residents to stay near protected areas.
HE_200	5	In response to the shooting, the IDF attacked Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.
HE_200	6	Fatah and the Popular Front in Gaza said that the shooting at Israel was carried out in response to the violent clashes taking place in Jerusalem in recent days.
HE_200	7	In the first rocket barrage, around 11:00 p.m., the Iron Dome system intercepted one rocket fired at the Kissuf area and two rockets fell in open areas.
HE_200	8	In response to the rocket fire, an IDF tank shelled a Hamas position.
HE_200	9	According to reports in Gaza, this is an observation post of the organization east of the Alborij refugee camp in the center of the Strip.
HE_200	10	After the IDF attack, dozens of additional rockets were fired at the localities of the Eshkol, Sdot Negev, Ashkelon Beach and Sha&#39;er HaNegev regional councils.
HE_200	11	The Iron Dome system intercepted three of the rockets and the rest landed in open areas.
HE_200	12	The IDF stated that fighter jets and aircraft attacked Hamas launchers and infrastructure in the Gaza Strip in response.
HE_200	13	Following the shooting, tonight the Home Front Command instructed the residents of the settlements surrounding Gaza to stay near protected areas and prohibited the holding of events in open areas and agricultural work at a distance of less than four kilometers from the border fence, this morning the instructions were canceled and the regional councils instructed the residents to return to full routine.
HE_200	14	Two organizations in Gaza announced that they were responsible for firing the rockets tonight at Israel: the Al Aqsa Brigades faction, which is an official arm of Fatah in Gaza, and the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades of the Popular Front.
HE_200	15	In a statement published by the organizations, it was stated that the shooting was carried out in response to the recent events in Jerusalem.
HE_200	16	Al Aqsa Brigades spokesman said: &quot;We will burn the Israeli settlements for your sake, Jerusalem.&quot;
HE_200	17	The Popular Front stated that they responded by shooting after Israel attacked in the Gaza Strip.
HE_200	18	In Gaza, they explain that the two organizations are indeed among the armed factions in the Gaza Strip, and in what is defined as the &quot;joint operations room&quot; of the factions in Gaza, but such shooting would not have taken place without the approval of Hamas or turning a blind eye on its part.
HE_200	19	Last night, hundreds of Palestinians clashed with the police in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
HE_200	20	This is the 11th night in a row of clashes in the eastern part of the city, which began against the background of the police&#39;s decision to prevent sitting on the steps at the Nablus Gate.
HE_200	21	The police protestors threw stones and shot fireworks at police officers in the Silwan neighborhood.
HE_200	22	A security guard was hit in the head, apparently by a stone, and needed medical attention.
HE_200	23	Two protesters were arrested.
HE_200	24	At Rachel&#39;s grave, dozens of Palestinians clashed with police officers, throwing stones and throwing Molotov cocktails.
HE_200	25	In the Qalandiya crossing area, hundreds of Palestinians clashed with the police.
HE_200	26	According to the police, eight of the protesters were injured by shots fired by means of dispersing demonstrations.
HE_200	27	In the Shaar Shechem area of ​​Jerusalem, dozens of young people clashed with police officers, throwing stones and objects at them and shooting fireworks.
HE_200	28	One person was arrested.
HE_200	29	The Red Crescent in Jerusalem reported that 20 wounded were treated during the night from rubber bullets and tear gas in the Old City area.
HE_200	30	Four needed medical treatment in hospitals and the rest were treated in the field.
HE_201	1	With little fear: the story of 4 families who moved to the Gaza Strip despite the tensions in the south
HE_201	2	Four families from different communities in Israel, Ashkelon, Kiryat Gat, Bnei Ish and Nahariya, decided after the &quot;Guardian of the Walls&quot; operation to move to live in the Gaza Envelope.
HE_201	3	According to them, the quality of life, the open spaces and also Zionism, are what made them make the move.
HE_201	4	The security situation is a hindrance, they say, but &quot;pastoralism wins&quot;.
HE_201	5	Yigal and Hadas Krihli-David, arrived three weeks ago to the kibbutz together with the three children from Ashkelon.
HE_201	6	As with everyone who comes to the area, there is always a fear of the security situation.
HE_201	7	&quot;Those who don&#39;t think about the security situation are blind, you have to take that into account, in the Wall Guard we understood that they reach everywhere.
HE_201	8	We are aware of the dangers and learn about the noises and sensations.
HE_201	9	I think this place literally wraps.
HE_201	10	This is a quality place for children, there is a sense of community here.
HE_201	11	We have arrived at an amazing place,&quot; Hadas said.
HE_201	12	According to Yigal, during the Corona period they were &quot;looking for spaces, we passed the last round in Ashkelon, so there are proportions.
HE_201	13	We have a lot of fun here and it&#39;s good for us with the peace and without the pressure, there are no traffic jams, there are no roads, the children are here in the spaces.&quot;
HE_201	14	Not far from Migal and Hadas, Kitty Levy lives with her husband and their three children.
HE_201	15	She also arrived at Kibbutz Nirim after Operation Shomer Hahomet.
HE_201	16	&quot;I didn&#39;t hear an alarm here,&quot; she said.
HE_201	17	&quot;We moved a month ago, we arrived from Kiryat Gat.
HE_201	18	Our concern was only about the children from their acclimatization and integration.
HE_201	19	The security situation is not only in Otef, in Shomer Hahomet there were places that were kidnapped more.
HE_201	20	We enjoy the place very much, already at the entrance to the kibbutz you feel pastoral and you feel like a big holiday village.
HE_201	21	The security situation does sit in our mind, we do not ignore it or reduce its value,&quot; she said.
HE_201	22	&quot;We were looking for the added value of a community, moving here is a Zionist statement.
HE_201	23	I&#39;m still thinking about what will happen during the alarms, who will I take first and then I realize that we are not a holiday village.
HE_201	24	And yet, we recommend everyone to come and live here.
HE_201	25	Fear will not rule us.&quot;
HE_201	26	A few kilometers from Kibbutz Nirim, there is Kibbutz Kisufim, where new residents are boasting.
HE_201	27	Benny Hasson, the spokesman for the kibbutz, excitedly said that until five years ago, there were five children from the kibbutz in the schools in the area, today he is already talking about dozens of children.
HE_201	28	&quot;After Shumer Homot, we took in eight families, and at the same time there are four families that are interested in being taken into the kibbutz.
HE_201	29	I think there is an element of Zionism and life here is good, there is community life and a very high quality education system.
HE_201	30	A very supportive community.&quot;
HE_201	31	Vared Gilaur, her husband Elad and their two children, came to the sweepstakes after the operation ended.
HE_201	32	&quot;I am not afraid of the security situation, I experienced the second intifada.
HE_201	33	If I project stress and fear onto my children then they will grow up into a reality of anxiety.
HE_201	34	No one sleeps here today with shacks.
HE_201	35	Vared added that the family used to come to Kibbutz Hamon a lot in the past.
HE_201	36	&quot;We always dreamed of reaching a kibbutz and then we found Kissufim.
HE_201	37	We went to several kibbutzim in Otef, and here we found the community we were looking for.
HE_201	38	My husband Elad insisted on coming to the Gaza Strip due to ideology and Zionism.&quot;
HE_201	39	&quot;There were noises of explosions from the moment we arrived,&quot; says Vared, but adds that &quot;there was no alarm here.
HE_201	40	The Bnei Ish also had alarms and we know the issue.&quot;
HE_201	41	Tal and Shuki Par have been discussing the sweepstakes for a year and they are considered veterans there.
HE_201	42	They have already managed to go through a round of war.
HE_201	43	&quot;We arrived from Manhariya a year ago.
HE_201	44	I had concerns both because of the security situation and the distance from the families and we were looking for a community, and specifically a place where you only commit to a trial period.&quot;
HE_201	45	&quot;There are many good things in the kibbutz.
HE_201	46	We felt a change for the better in the quality of life.
HE_201	47	It was a terrible surprise that the security situation in Otefah bothered us less.
HE_201	48	We have a permanent rule where if the frames are closed due to a security situation then we travel north to the family.
HE_201	49	We grew up with Katyushas in Nahariya, so there is no place in Israel that is protected.
HE_201	50	It was in the north and could be anywhere.&quot;
HE_211	1	The court ordered the police to compensate a young man of Ethiopian origin who was detained &quot;because of the color of his skin&quot;
HE_211	2	The Tel Aviv Magistrate&#39;s Court ordered the police to compensate a young man of Ethiopian origin who was detained by a police officer without reason about three years ago.
HE_211	3	In 2018, the young man, who was 15 years old at the time, left his home wearing sports clothes, and was arrested by an undercover police officer.
HE_211	4	The police questioned him about his actions in the neighborhood and conducted a search of his body and belongings without explanation on his part.
HE_211	5	Judge Yishai Koren wrote in his decision that &quot;I see no escape from the conclusion that the actions were done only because of the plaintiff&#39;s Ethiopian origin.&quot;
HE_211	6	The judge also ordered the police to pay court costs.
HE_211	7	The young man wrote in the affidavit that the policeman caught him while he was on his way to the gym, and took him under a residential building.
HE_211	8	He described how the officer asked him to empty his pockets and groped his body.
HE_211	9	&quot;I was terribly afraid but he left me no choice,&quot; he wrote in the affidavit.
HE_211	10	Finally, he described, he picked up his things from the floor.
HE_211	11	&quot;The whole incident lasted about 20 minutes, during which the policeman spoke to me in an aggressive and stressful tone and I answered like a robot because I was scared and stressed,&quot; it says.
HE_211	12	The young man even presented a message in which he told his family about the incident immediately after it, and his brother&#39;s contact to the police in real time following the incident.
HE_211	13	The police, for their part, claimed that they did not have any documentation of the case.
HE_211	14	The judge ruled that the young man&#39;s testimony is reliable.
HE_211	15	According to him, the fact that the police have no documentation of this is serious.
HE_211	16	&quot;It is unlikely that a 15.5-year-old minor is detained by a police officer or detective and his body and belongings are searched without this being documented in an action report,&quot; the judge wrote.
HE_211	17	&quot;In the absence of documentation by the defendant, and in the absence of any explanation for this serious conduct towards the plaintiff, I see no escape from the conclusion that the actions were taken only because of the plaintiff&#39;s Ethiopian origin and his labeling as a potential criminal only on the basis of the color of his skin.
HE_211	18	It seems to me the plaintiff&#39;s claim that in view of the findings regarding excessive policing towards the members of the Ethiopian community, the police have an increased duty of care when taking policing measures against the members of the community.&quot;
HE_211	19	In his lawsuit, the young man described two other incidents that happened to him.
HE_211	20	According to him, in 2015, when he was 13 years old, he left a grocery store in his neighborhood with a bag in his hands.
HE_211	21	The young man said that the police questioned him about the contents of the bag and asked him where the watch and necklace he was wearing came from and what he was doing in the neighborhood.
HE_211	22	According to him, when asked what he had in the bag, he answered &quot;chocolate and a bun.&quot;
HE_211	23	The representative of the prosecutor&#39;s office, Adv.
HE_211	24	The judge accepted the young man&#39;s version of the case, but also the police&#39;s version, according to which there are not enough details to find out.
HE_211	25	The judge did not award damages in favor of the young man because the case was described as a background to the events and not as part of the lawsuit.
HE_211	26	The third case happened in 2019.
HE_211	27	The young man was staying with his friend near his house, when policemen passing by questioned them about their actions.
HE_211	28	The attorney&#39;s office representative said that this was a routine patrol and that the police officers suspected that they were observers connected to a burglary squad, so they approached the two.
HE_211	29	According to the prosecutor&#39;s office, since there was a white friend in the place and the police approached both of them, it is not racism.
HE_211	30	In this case, the judge ruled that he found no fault in the conduct of the police officers.
HE_211	31	The young man claimed NIS 50,000 for the cases in 2018 and 2019 through the lawyers Anne Sucio and Avner Pinchuk who represented him on behalf of the Civil Rights Association.
HE_211	32	The young man wrote in his affidavit that since he was detained by the undercover policeman he tries not to go out alone in his neighborhood in the evenings, he started walking only in streets where there are a large number of people and avoided going out to places of entertainment with friends in the evenings.
HE_211	33	&quot;Every time I see the police I get stressed and look to go into the store so I&#39;m not just outside in case the police see me,&quot; he wrote.
HE_211	34	The young man&#39;s brother told the court that one evening a car drove by in the neighborhood and even though he was at home he became anxious just because of the noise.
HE_211	35	&quot;His trust in the police system is non-existent and he is very afraid of encountering the police even though he has no reason to be afraid.&quot;
HE_211	36	The attorney&#39;s office said: &quot;The court rejected most of the prosecution&#39;s claims in light of the totality of the evidence and testimonies presented to it.
HE_211	37	Regarding the incident for which the claimant was compensated, despite a thorough investigation conducted by the police, no documentation was found that verifies its occurrence.
HE_211	38	In the coming days we will study the decision in depth and consider our steps.&quot;
HE_211	39	Attorney Sucio from the Civil Rights Association said: &quot;The verdict is an important step in eradicating racial profiling in the conduct of the police.
HE_211	40	The excessive policing of minorities produces long-term damage in the minds of those young people who are repeatedly labeled as criminals.
HE_211	41	It is appropriate for the police to draw lessons from this case and work to eradicate the phenomenon of profiling.&quot;
HE_217	1	Kahana: &quot;I get the impression that Orbach will certainly not stop the formation of the government&quot;
HE_217	2	Member of Knesset Matan Kahana (right) spoke today (Monday) with Ben Caspit and Vinon Magal on their show on 103FM.
HE_217	3	At the beginning of the conversation Magal stated that Kahana disappointed him personally when he chose to join the &quot;Government of Change&quot;, Kahana replied: &quot;I am disappointed that I disappointed you and that there are those who were disappointed, I feel that in the situation that was created there was no escape from going to this government and I think that great things can come out of it for the citizens of the State of Israel &quot;.
HE_217	4	&quot;I was part of the efforts to establish a right-wing government, we acted decisively, I went to the rabbis, members of the Knesset, we did everything but there was no right-wing government, it was impossible to establish a government,&quot; he added, &quot;Am I satisfied that we did not keep all our promises?
HE_217	5	No.
HE_217	6	In the situation that has arisen, should we go to the government we are establishing?
HE_217	7	Yes&quot;.
HE_217	8	Kahana also said that &quot;Bennett was ready to give up a lot of things in order for a right-wing government to be established, but there is none.
HE_217	9	If the government succeeds, there is great news for the citizens of the State of Israel, the news of unity between the right, center and left.&quot;
HE_217	10	When asked what right-wing ideology his party would be able to promote in the emerging government, he replied: &quot;We will protect the Land of Israel and the values ​​of Judaism more than Netanyahu who handed over Hebron, gave the speech of the two states and did not assert sovereignty.&quot;
HE_217	11	&quot;Will there be a breakthrough of right-wing ideology here?
HE_217	12	The answer is probably not.
HE_217	13	Just like there won&#39;t be a breakthrough by the left, there won&#39;t be a breakthrough by the right, there will be a government that will do great things,&quot; he said.
HE_217	14	Later in his speech, he referred to the fact that, unlike the other members of his party, he did not need security: &quot;There are far fewer threats to me than to others.&quot;
HE_217	15	According to him, what is happening around the members of the Knesset is inappropriate: &quot;From a deep acquaintance with the rabbis who signed the letter, they are the furthest thing in the world from incitement.
HE_217	16	I am in contact with them and none of them think of physical or verbal violence.&quot; &quot;99.9 percent of people understand very well what he means, you still have to be careful at the end.
HE_217	17	When rabbis say &#39;everything&#39; and connect it to the fact that the Prime Minister says that we are a danger to IDF soldiers, one can be confused enough to take action.
HE_217	18	However, it is allowed and desirable to protest and I understand those who protest,&quot; he added.
HE_217	19	Regarding the warning given by the head of the Shin Bet regarding the incitement, the Knesset member said: &quot;I don&#39;t tend to attribute political thinking to the heads of our security services, I think they are above this.
HE_217	20	In the context of the rabbis&#39; letter, it is 100 percent clear to me that none of the signed rabbis dreams of violence, but there should be vigilant shooters with more sensitivity.&quot;
HE_217	21	When asked about a member of his party, MK Nir Orbach, who these days is debating whether to enter the government of change, Kahane said: &quot;I get the impression that he will certainly not be the one to stop the formation of the government and I hope he will be in the government, Orbach understands that this is far from a left-wing government.&quot;
HE_217	22	Later in his speech, he addressed the question of whether the Speaker of the Knesset should advance the vote in light of the pressures and tensions: &quot;I think the state thing to do is bring this government to the swearing-in this Wednesday, it&#39;s a done deal.
HE_217	23	It&#39;s a decision only by the speaker of the Knesset and in a democratic country it&#39;s perfectly fine for the government to change from time to time, there&#39;s no tragedy here.&quot;
HE_217	24	&quot;We know that what the Likud is trying to do is to set the area on fire, that&#39;s enough.
HE_217	25	Let&#39;s move the government, let&#39;s remind Netanyahu of the good things he did during the years he was prime minister, and let&#39;s not leave scorched earth here,&quot; he concluded.
HE_M_009	1	The Labor Party will work to strengthen the public education system and adapt it to the 21st century, by guaranteeing a continuum of quality public education at no cost from the end of maternity leave until the end of the 12th grade.
HE_M_009	2	To this end, we will take steps to strengthen and improve the conditions of the educational staff and auxiliary staff and their status, to improve the relationship between the educational staff and the male and female students, and to promote differential budgeting and reduce educational gaps between the center and the periphery.
HE_M_009	3	Also, we will work for a significant promotion of ultra-orthodox state education and its anchoring in the law and the assimilation of the core studies in all educational frameworks.
HE_M_009	4	Comprehensive reform in urban planning and acceleration of urban renewal processes: We will carry out a comprehensive reform of the planning director and the planning and construction committees in order to significantly speed up the pace of apartment planning, and to change the nature of urban planning so that suburban construction is reduced and urban renewal and textured construction are promoted, alongside massive development of transportation, leisure, and education infrastructures and a view
HE_M_009	5	Quality public education from birth: We will formulate a government program that will be enshrined in legislation for free public education for every girl, from the end of maternity leave until the age of three.
HE_M_009	6	In addition to this, we will work to find immediate solutions to the acute crisis in the daycare centers by improving the ratio between the number of caregivers and the number of toddlers, improving the wages and working conditions of the caregivers and helpers, and improving the educational and safety supervision of the centers.
HE_M_009	7	Adding a temporary credit point for post-secondary graduates: In light of the sharp increase in the cost of living, we will work to restore the tax credit point for post-secondary graduates in the years 2023-2025.
HE_M_009	8	Dormitories for male and female students: We will increase the government&#39;s investment in student dormitories, and we will work to adopt a five-year plan to double the number of dormitories through government aid to higher education institutions.
HE_M_009	9	Limiting payments in higher education institutions: We will create supervision and limit the amounts charged by the budgeted academic institutions in addition to tuition.
HE_M_009	10	Expanding academic study tracks without the need for a psychometric test: We will expand the tracks that allow entry into academic studies even without a psychometric test, and we will work to implement them in all the academic institutions that the state budgets for.
HE_M_009	11	public education.
HE_M_009	12	The Labor Party is committed to investing in the next generation of Israelis through increasing investment in the education system in all its parts, and through ensuring the public nature of the system and implementing the obligation to free education.
HE_M_009	13	This commitment is reflected in standing by the teachers, the kindergarteners and all the workers in the auxiliary educational professions.
HE_M_009	14	Improving their status, their wages, their working conditions and their training is a fundamental condition for ensuring the quality of the Israeli education system.
HE_M_009	15	The Labor Party will work in the 25th Knesset and in the next government to achieve the following goals: Free public and high-quality education for ages 0-3: We will provide free education for every boy and girl from the end of maternity leave until the age of three, instead of the partial subsidy provided today which is insufficient.
HE_M_009	16	In addition to this, we will work to improve the ratio between the number of nannies and the number of toddlers, to improve the training, wages and working conditions of the nannies and assistants, and to improve the supervision of day care centers.
HE_M_009	17	Salary increase for pink-collar workers in the education system: We will significantly raise the wages for pink-collar workers in the education system, including teachers, counselors, nannies, kindergarten teachers and assistants, who work in the state service and in the services budgeted by the state.
HE_M_009	18	Reducing the number of children in kindergarten and school classes: We will implement the standard recommended in the Rosenthal Committee&#39;s report for early childhood: a caregiver for four children up to the age of 15 months, a caregiver for seven children up to the age of two, and a caregiver for eight children up to the age of three.
HE_M_009	19	We will also add an assistant to each kindergarten for ages 3-6 where there are over 30 boys and girls, and we will limit the number of students in the class to 30.
HE_M_009	20	Expansion of a long education day to additional localities: We will lift the freeze on the expansion of a long education day, and we will gradually implement the program in additional localities until it is fully implemented all over the country by the end of 2026.

HE_M_009	23	Changing the supervision system and transferring responsibility to the field: We will change the supervision system, which currently makes it difficult for principals and teachers to be independent, and turn it into an advisory and accompanying system.
HE_M_009	24	Among other things, much more freedom is given than is currently given to principals and teachers to choose some of the study subjects and study methods.
HE_M_009	25	Differential budgeting: We will extend the differential budgeting in the education system to kindergarten and high school ages as well, and apply it to all budget components.

HE_M_014	1	Economy and cost of living The State of Israel should and can be among the most prosperous countries in the world, with a high quality of life.
HE_M_014	2	The world is currently in an economic crisis due to the effects of the Corona epidemic and the damage to the supply chains.
HE_M_014	3	In addition we are dealing with a global energy crisis resulting from the war between Russia and Ukraine.
HE_M_014	4	In order to deal with the economic crisis, we must continue to promote the free economic policy that we have led over the past year.
HE_M_014	5	The entry of international chains, increased competition in the field of imports, removal of barriers and reduction of regulation while investing massively in national infrastructure projects - they are what will bring down the cost of living in Israel.
HE_M_014	6	Also, additional populations must be integrated into the workforce.
HE_M_014	7	When the ultra-Orthodox and Arab population and the other minorities in the country integrate into the labor market, the burden on the working population will be reduced and the welfare of those populations will be upgraded.
HE_M_014	8	Expanding the circle of those eligible for a job grant - for singles over the age of 26 up to a salary of NIS 8,000 per month.

HE_M_014	11	The dissolution of the production councils - the poultry and plant councils - putting an end to the monopolies that make food more expensive for all of us, canceling child allowances from the 5th child.
HE_M_014	12	We will strengthen the local economy by investing in the cleantech, agritech and foodtech industries.
HE_M_020	1	Education The education system is the most important resource for the establishment of a democratic, egalitarian and successful society.
HE_M_020	2	The education system is a way to strengthen the citizens&#39; ability to be active partners in shaping society and their ability to criticize the existing and contribute to correcting its ways and its prosperity.
HE_M_020	3	It is the power of the education system to provide its students with qualifications and skills required for proper functioning in a progressive and groundbreaking society, to strengthen democratic trends and to lead values ​​of social solidarity.
HE_M_020	4	Instead of doing this, the system deals with estimates and indicators, which it also succeeds with great difficulty, and with tours of &quot;heritage sites&quot; in the occupied territories.
HE_M_020	5	The reforms they announced in the elementary and secondary schools are not particularly good for the teachers.
HE_M_020	6	Their wages still remain low, they work without reasonable conditions in the schools, the classes are bursting with students, and in the matriculation exams they see everything.
HE_M_020	7	Legislation of a law on free education from the age of three months.
HE_M_020	8	Every child in Israel will be entitled to free education from the age of three months until the end of high school.
HE_M_020	9	This is subject to the adaptation of the structures, the increase of the staff and the reduction of the norm in the ages of 3-4 to 25 children per 3 staff members, the reduction of the number of students in the class, the abolition of the phenomenon of parental payments in the public education system, the halting of all privatization moves, foreign sources, and the introduction of commercial elements into the core of the education system beyond policy of zero private money in the education system differential funding for local authorities in the field of education for the purpose of creating a national level of equality per student encouraging education for values, democracy and peace fostering humanistic education Meretz strives for an education system that represents in its content the rich cultural and historical diversity of Israeli society in all its parts.
HE_M_020	10	Action must be taken to correct the deficient and biased representation of the history and culture of Mizrahim, people of the USSR, people of Ethiopia, and Palestinians who are citizens of Israel in the curricula of literature, history, citizenship and other fields. the potential inherent in them, and prepare them for higher education and further studies in any track they choose
HE_M_020	11	Encouraging educational innovation, the main of which is the use of technological tools to improve the teaching and learning processes in the school. Establishing libraries for lending textbooks in all schools in the country. Instilling the values ​​of gender equality in the curricula from early childhood to the adult levels. In the textbooks encouraging girls to choose science and technology subjects, emphasis will be placed on education for an environmental perspective and sustainable living
HE_M_020	12	Education system budgeting
HE_M_020	13	Since education is one of the most influential variables on an individual&#39;s earning capacity and economic well-being, it is necessary to strive to create equal educational opportunities by eliminating the advantages that the established classes or favored sectors have.
HE_M_020	14	In light of data that reveal the huge gaps between the established social strata and the underprivileged in terms of educational opportunities (inequality in conditions and resources) and in academic achievements (academic results) and in light of the unacceptable gaps between the funding rates of Jewish and Arab schools, mainly for the benefit of religious state education, there is To create a transparent resource allocation format that will ensure that all children will enjoy equal educational opportunities, and that as long as gaps exist, a policy of positive preference towards the disadvantaged and excluded populations will be implemented.
HE_M_020	15	The educators The quality of the education system depends on the quality of its teachers.
HE_M_020	16	In the end, it is determined in the classroom and is largely influenced by the character and level of knowledge of the educator.
HE_M_020	17	The quiet process of privatization in the education system in Israel resulted in 60% of the schools having teachers employed through associations or contractor employers, when no body checks their level of training and terms of employment.
HE_M_020	18	The status of the teacher in Israel must be significantly improved, and any systemic change in education must be made in cooperation and consultation with the teachers.
HE_M_020	19	Early childhood
HE_M_020	20	Investing in early childhood education is an essential and important investment in the future of Israeli society, the return of which is worthwhile both for the development of the future economy, both for reducing disparities and for saving future state expenditures on health, welfare and education.
HE_M_020	21	Moreover, this is our duty towards the toddlers and children and this is their right according to the international convention for the benefit of the child.
HE_M_020	22	Therefore, action must be taken to improve the existing conditions in kindergartens and to government regulation of the after-school sector in Israel.
HE_M_020	23	Higher education
HE_M_020	24	Access to higher education Expanding the academic circle is both a social-national and personal need.
HE_M_020	25	Reduction of the tuition fee until it is placed on a symbolic amount, of seriousness fees only.
HE_M_020	26	There will be no differential tuition fees between different classes. Running programs and allocating appropriate resources to educational institutions in peripheral areas and among disadvantaged populations - Arabs, Mizrahi, Ethiopians and former Soviet expatriates - to enable accessibility and encourage equality in higher education
HE_M_020	27	Increasing the representation of women, Arabs, Mizrahi, Ethiopians and former USSR expatriates in the academic staff
HE_M_020	28	Academic freedom In recent years, classes and departments in universities have been attacked for political reasons and regardless of their academic conduct.
HE_M_020	29	To ensure the continued advancement and excellence of the higher education system in Israel, academic freedom must be protected.
HE_M_020	30	The management of the universities, the appointment of the heads of the academic and research system, the outline of the academic development policy and the distribution of the budgets should be entrusted only to the scientists and researchers.
HE_M_020	31	Academic freedom must be guaranteed on two levels: personal academic freedom - which allows each member of the academic faculty to determine the direction of his or her research and the content of the teaching without external interference and without fear of his status institutional academic freedom - which gives each academic institution the full right to determine its academic agenda and methods its management, and protects it from external governmental or other interference Ensuring the independent status of the Council for Higher Education (HEC) and establishing the status, independence and powers of the Committee for Planning and Budgeting (VAT) Returning the management of universities to the hands of the academic community and basing academic management on open and broad discussion Made possible by the participation of all members of the community - lecturers, students and administrative staff
HE_M_024	1	Environmental incentives and green taxation Israel has pledged to increase the use of renewable energies, but the rate of progress is very slow.
HE_M_024	2	Clear economic incentives must be created for effective environmental behavior: the creation of a taxation system and mechanisms that will financially incentivize companies and factories that reduce carbon emissions and use renewable energies, similar to the plan approved in Australia.
HE_M_024	3	Reduction of concessions for leasing - it will not be possible to recognize fuel paid to an employee as corporate expenses without a limit on the total number of kilometers traveled by the employee.
HE_M_024	4	Amending the law on condominiums, so that it will be possible to erect solar panels on the roofs of condominiums, without the need for the consent of all the tenants. Placing a state guarantee for loans through non-profit entities, for the establishment of renewable energy systems. Emphasis will be placed on education for an environmental perspective and sustainable living.
HE_M_024	5	Energy Israel has a huge potential for producing energy from renewable sources.
HE_M_024	6	Their use, and especially solar energy, is an advantage both from an environmental and economic, social and health point of view.
HE_M_024	7	Israel has pledged to increase the use of renewable energies, but the rate of progress is very slow.
HE_M_024	8	Utilizing this channel will reduce Israel&#39;s dependence on oil exporting countries and lead to economic independence.
HE_M_024	9	The production of electricity from renewable energy sources should be encouraged and the development of a blue and white solar market should be encouraged which will also be used for export.
HE_M_024	10	The discovery of large natural gas reserves off the shores of the Mediterranean only recently brought with it excitement and manifestations of joy, but it must be remembered that natural gas is also a fossil energy source, the production and utilization of which involve a lot of pollution and its storage poses a risk to the residents living in the neighborhood of these reserves.
HE_M_024	11	Meretz will work to promote the following issues: reducing emissions to 0 in 2030 and aiming for renewable energies of 10% in 2030 and 110% in 2050. Implementation of a comprehensive policy of efficiency and savings in state institutions, the security system, in the industrial, agricultural, business and private sectors. Implementation of a decision The government to establish a solar power plant in the Negev, taking into account sensitive sites that maintain desert ecosystems Promoting a national plan for energy efficiency in order to integrate these sources into the Israeli electricity sector Promoting the production of energy from waste through legislation, resources, tools and designated areas for this purpose Providing long-term incentives and commitments for the purchase price of renewable energy , for the production and use of solar energy for home consumption, in factories and public places, with a preference for public bodies and cooperatives, a ban on the construction of new power plants based on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas, and a ban on expanding the scope of activities of the existing ones, the lifting of the freeze on the national plan to reduce emissions, and it will be expanded to other areas which have not yet received the answer of providing incentives for the replacement, improvement and upgrading of energy-efficient equipment and mechanization anchoring in legislation the regulations to stop the use of incandescent bulbs and to outlaw them within a specified period of time, similar to the legislation in various European countries following recent UN reports, from which it appears that the main factor For the emission of greenhouse gases is industrialized agricultural farms, the agricultural policy in Israel, especially in the livestock farms, and the accompanying consumer and commercial policy must be examined, and subject to the rules of protecting the environment and reducing the emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases, there must be transparency and the transfer of current information regarding the use of nuclear energy in Israel and methods of burying nuclear waste.
HE_M_024	12	Nuclear energy should not be developed without direct legislation on this matter, which also includes systems of supervision and control. Updating the Petroleum Law, which allows entrepreneurs to search for and produce oil, so that environmental considerations, transparency, and public participation will be taken into account when granting permits to entrepreneurs. will be incorporated into legislation.
HE_M_032	1	Yesh Atid Economy and Society Platform believes that the Israeli government should promote an economic policy that encourages growth in all branches of the economy, increases productivity and reduces disparities that have developed in the last decade in Israel.
HE_M_032	2	We will continue to do this by strengthening the existing growth engines, identifying and creating new growth engines, encouraging investments in the periphery in the fields of high-tech, advanced and innovative industry, and by accelerating advanced digitization and management processes in the trade and service sectors.
HE_M_032	3	and appropriate human capital development.
HE_M_032	4	We will encourage the expansion and strengthening of industry, commerce and services through routes to encourage capital investments, state grants, benefits for the entry of global companies into Israel and government investment in the transition to advanced production processes.
HE_M_032	5	At the same time, we will continue to expand the programs led and implemented by the government to reduce regulation, to remove barriers and to improve and shorten establishment and licensing procedures for factories and businesses and to significantly improve Israel&#39;s place in the international index of ease of doing business and the index of competitiveness in the economy.
HE_M_032	6	Yesh Atid will continue to direct budgets and reduce taxes to the middle class and vulnerable populations which will lead to the narrowing of social gaps, to strengthening the economy, to growth through an incentive policy to encourage going to work and to increase the rate of work participation among ultra-Orthodox men and Arab women.
HE_M_032	7	The cost of living and increasing disposable income: during a year of intensive work, Yesh Atid led a responsible economic policy, followed by unprecedented reforms, aimed at lowering the cost of living, increasing the variety of products and services for the consumer and bringing about a real and structural turning point that will lead to an improvement in the quality of life index.
HE_M_032	8	Along with the actions to reduce costs for the consumer, we worked to increase income for families through an increase in the job grant, a tax reduction for working families with children and an unprecedented investment in increasing the earning capacity of citizens through professional training, encouraging employment in high-paying industries and professions and encouraging employers to improve skills and employ workers in human capital investment tracks.
HE_M_032	9	As mentioned, in the area of ​​the cost of living, we are witnessing worldwide price increases at rates of over 9% inflation in most Western European countries and the USA.
HE_M_032	10	The origin of the price increases is the effects of the Corona epidemic, the lack of raw materials, the increase in the cost of sea transportation, as well as the effect of the war in Ukraine on sources of energy, wheat, metals and more.
HE_M_032	11	Yesh Atid has made dealing with the cost of living in Israel an important goal.
HE_M_032	12	That is why you will continue to promote the reforms and processes that you led last year, which allowed for a much more moderate increase in prices than the one that exists in most countries of the world, and in the future will even lead to a decrease in prices in all areas of life.
HE_M_032	13	Growth: We assumed and strengthened capabilities and infrastructure that will encourage and support the acceleration of growth in the economy - we signed the first trade agreement with an Arab country, between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and strengthened economic relations with many countries; We raised the retirement age for women; We reformed business licensing; As a result, we led Israel to an unprecedented growth of over 8%, to minimal unemployment and an increase in the volume of exports of 21%.
HE_M_032	14	All of these led to a zero deficit and the creation of a long-term economic infrastructure, the results of which we will see in the coming years.
HE_M_032	15	In order to continue growth, reduce disparities and maintain Israel&#39;s position as one of the most stable and growing economies in the world, we will lead a responsible social economic policy: increasing productivity and accelerating growth - Yesh Atid will work to define and implement productivity indicators in government programs, to set government productivity targets for human capital, for peripheral areas and various industries, For the digitization of horizontal government processes vis-à-vis the business sector (such as business licensing, imports, and a government personal zone for businesses), we will create mass transit infrastructure and public transportation accessible to all and formulate a multi-year government plan to increase productivity.
HE_M_032	16	Assimilation of technology and innovation throughout the economy - Assimilation of innovative technologies and tools throughout the economy is a necessary condition for increasing productivity in Israel.
HE_M_032	17	Yesh Atid will work for this, in different ways.
HE_M_032	18	Increasing the portfolio of financial services for the business sector - the business sector today is characterized by cash flow problems and strict conditions imposed by financial institutions in order to receive funding for their current activities.
HE_M_032	19	This is a barrier for these businesses to develop.
HE_M_032	20	Therefore, we will work to expand the portfolio of financing services for the business sector, such as: promoting the stock market for small businesses, developing an inter-sector fund for development and growth engines in the periphery and cooperation with the institutional bodies.
HE_M_032	21	Strengthening international economic activity - the economic cooperation between the various countries is a catalyst for strengthening the Israeli economy.
HE_M_032	22	In 2021, the volume of Israeli exports increased in an unprecedented manner by a rate of 21% and in the first half of 2022 there is a further increase in a similar rate.
HE_M_032	23	Yesh Atid will continue to work to encourage the export of the State of Israel, to lead economic cooperation in the Middle East, promote trade agreements with other countries such as India, Japan, South Korea and Bahrain, continue to encourage the entry of foreign investments and other international companies into Israel, as well as assisting Israeli businesses in promoting Cooperations and transactions in the countries of the world.
HE_M_032	24	Increasing competition and reducing the cost of living - In the past year, the Minister of Economy and Industry led a determined economic policy to combat the cost of living: the import reform came into effect in June 2022 and aims to lower import barriers and increase competition in the Israeli economy for the benefit of the Israeli consumer; We added tax credit points for working parents, in order to increase disposable income; We lowered tariffs on hundreds of consumer products, raw materials for industry, food and more; We encouraged the entry of foreign chains into Israel; And we led reforms in business licensing.
HE_M_032	25	In the area of ​​housing, we have led processes that will affect apartment prices in the coming years, primarily a doubling of the scope of building permits and construction starts, along with the launch of housing plans for residents and changes in the price-fixing and taxation policy.
HE_M_032	26	Increasing participation in the labor force - today the participation rate of some of the populations in Israeli society in the employment circle is very low for various reasons.
HE_M_032	27	Furthermore, there are different populations that are part of the labor market, but do not reach their full potential, and earn from low-wage jobs.
HE_M_032	28	Yesh Atid believes that it is our duty as a society to promote the integration of all populations into the labor market, including target populations whose participation rate is particularly low, as both an economic and social necessity.
HE_M_034	1	Aliyah and Absorption &quot;The State of Israel shall be open to Jewish Aliyah and Kibbutz Glioyot&quot; (from the Megillah Ha&#39;Atswam).
HE_M_034	2	The State of Israel is the state of all the Jews of the world, and thus its gates will be open as the home of Diaspora and Diaspora Jews.
HE_M_034	3	Israel was built by immigrants and continues to develop thanks to them.
HE_M_034	4	Because of this strength of the land, Yesh Atid sees it as a legal, moral and ethical duty to encourage and accept any Jew who wishes to exercise his right to immigrate to Israel.
HE_M_034	5	Yesh Atid sees the commitment to absorption and immigration as the duty of the State of Israel to be responsible for the optimal absorption of new immigrants and thus to pave the new path of the immigrants, to help them settle in the country successfully, at the same time as providing accessible and effective tools and services, and to guarantee that every immigrant will be answered to the difficulties that arise in his path .
HE_M_034	6	Yesh Atid has acted, and will continue to act, in the face of the many challenges facing the immigrant population, the most prominent of which is the difficulty of integrating into employment.
HE_M_034	7	We will work to continue promoting the integration of the new immigrants into the labor market, we will enable the rapid integration of immigrants into the professions they were engaged in before immigrating by converting professional licenses, we will conduct professional exams in the original language and we will work to create incentives for employers to hire new immigrants in general.
HE_M_034	8	We will work to expand assistance to new immigrants to ensure their successful absorption.
HE_M_034	9	We will take care of the expansion of the envelope and assistance for immigrant children in the education system and outside, we will offer solutions as broad as possible to soften the absorption crises experienced by families in the years after immigration.
HE_M_034	10	We will also improve and streamline the &quot;Ha-Olapan&quot; program, among other things through smaller classes and up-to-date study material with linguistic accessibility, we will make sure to extend the time it takes to exercise the right to subsidized Hebrew studies provided by the state.
HE_M_034	11	We will find advanced solutions for language teaching, including online.
HE_M_034	12	We will focus unique assistance on senior citizens and elderly immigrants in order to adapt and make the services provided to the elderly more accessible.
HE_M_034	13	We will continue to care for individual immigrant soldiers, before, during and after their military service, and to strengthen the connection of Jews abroad with Israel through Zionist projects that encourage their immigration to Israel, which is essential for Israel&#39;s growth and ensuring its strength.
HE_M_037	1	Environmental protection, sustainability and the climate crisis.
HE_M_037	2	Yesh Atid is committed to leading a policy that promotes the preservation of environmental resources, the reduction and prevention of pollution and environmental risks and also the acceleration of the transition to renewable energies, energy efficiency and the reduction of private travel.
HE_M_037	3	We see protecting the environment as part of our commitment to future generations, and recognize the close relationship between the way the state protects nature, the quality of natural resources, water, biodiversity, sources of energy and food, and animals, and between the quality of life and the future of humans.
HE_M_037	4	Likewise, the use of public transportation should be encouraged, the transition to electric public transportation should be accelerated, and ecological consumption habits should be encouraged.
HE_M_037	5	Climate Law.
HE_M_037	6	Israel needs an ambitious climate law that will cast the normative framework for a comprehensive governmental response to the climate crisis - will anchor the super goals in primary legislation and establish a mechanism of supervision and control over its implementation by government ministries.
HE_M_037	7	There is a determined future to enact the climate law in second and third reading out of a commitment to bring the State of Israel to a state of carbon neutrality by 2050.
HE_M_037	8	Reliable, clean and cheap energy Yesh Atid will continue to work to create an efficient and green energy economy while gradually and responsibly reducing Israel&#39;s dependence on fossil fuels and accelerating the transition to renewable energies.
HE_M_037	9	In the past year, Energy Minister Karin Elharer promoted the agro-voltaic project for the establishment of renewable energies in agricultural areas, requiring the establishment of solar energy facilities on educational institutions and promoting regional energy managers to encourage renewable energies in the local authorities in order to create a fast track for connecting dual-use solar facilities.
HE_M_037	10	Also, in the last year many resources were invested in research and development, promoting companies in the fields of storage, hydrogen, green energies and other companies as a basis for international cooperation that will help fight the climate crisis.
HE_M_037	11	Environmental urban planning Yesh Atid believes that quality and correct urban planning is an important first-rate answer to the problems of the environment, health and quality of life in the city.
HE_M_037	12	We believe that the space in which we live has an immeasurable effect on the quality of our lives, therefore we will make sure that the open spaces are accessible to all layers of the population, encourage social interaction and are maintained at a high level.
HE_M_037	13	There is a future initiative for future planning for urban nature.
HE_M_037	14	There is also a future that will promote urban agriculture on the roofs of buildings in cities through the creation of economic incentives to encourage optimal utilization of built-up areas (dual use).
HE_M_037	15	Protection of ecological corridors and open spaces Yesh Atid will work to strengthen the protection of ecological corridors and open spaces in the State of Israel.
HE_M_037	16	We believe that urban and inter-urban planning must balance the needs of construction and development and the values ​​of preserving nature.
HE_M_037	17	Yesh Atid will make sure that this balance will be maintained in all planning institutions in Israel, and that the values ​​of nature will receive a thorough and appropriate consideration in all construction plans.
HE_M_037	18	The construction plans in the White Ridge - Yesh Atid opposes the construction plans in the Jerusalem mountains.
HE_M_037	19	Sustainable Transportation Yesh Atid believes that the state&#39;s investment in public transportation infrastructure and innovative transportation solutions will reduce the number of road accidents, reduce social gaps, create jobs, preserve open spaces and reduce air pollution.
HE_M_037	20	In order to reduce the dependence on the private car and the problem of congestion on the roads, Yesh Atid will work so that most of the services for the resident are within walking or cycling distance.
HE_M_037	21	We will continue to work to expand public transportation in Israel and make it more accessible, and in the process - the full transition to electric buses, continuing to create wide accessible and shaded walkways for pedestrians, as the government began to implement in a government program for shading that was approved last year, the development of urban and intercity bike paths and the establishment of new open spaces for the benefit of the public .
HE_M_037	22	Energy platform - reliable, clean and cheap energy Yesh Atid sees a national goal in reducing pollution and reducing citizens&#39; expenses on energy (electricity and fuel).
HE_M_037	23	We will work to create a reliable, efficient and green energy economy and strive to lower the cost of living in order to maintain the energy security of the State of Israel.
HE_M_037	24	Israel as a significant player in the international energy market.
HE_M_037	25	As part of the assessments to deal with the climate crisis, we will continue to work to promote the transition to a greener and more efficient economy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector.
HE_M_037	26	In the 36th government, we led two key steps that will make this possible - first, the transition to green energies and technical energy efficiency, investment in research and development in the energy sector.
HE_M_037	27	We will continue and lead a revolution in the electricity sector so that every citizen can choose his electricity supplier and thus lower energy costs for households.
HE_M_037	28	Installing smart meters and spreading household consumption over more hours will make it possible to save on electricity infrastructure and save on costs.
HE_M_037	29	Positioning the State of Israel as a significant power in the field of energy.
HE_M_037	30	In the last year we signed a series of agreements with countries that were previously considered hostile..
HE_M_037	31	These agreements proved that the energy field is a bridge between countries and can create relations of cooperation and even mutual dependence on the way to stabilizing the entire Middle East region.
HE_M_037	32	Upgrading the electricity sector and the electricity transmission network.
HE_M_037	33	The Israeli electricity grid is not adapted to the transition to renewable energies and a decentralized and modern electricity system.
HE_M_037	34	That is why in the last year we worked to promote a new plan for the electricity sector which will take us from our current situation to a modern, stable and reliable electricity sector which will also lead to meeting the renewable energy goals for 2030.
HE_M_037	35	As part of this plan, the electricity network infrastructures that exist today must be doubled.
HE_M_037	36	The promotion of electrical infrastructure facilities in Israel takes over ten years on average in Israel, so we worked to remove barriers to the planning and construction of electrical infrastructure in Israel.
HE_M_037	37	These infrastructures will allow us to make the long-awaited transition to renewable energies.
HE_M_037	38	Promotion of projects for the establishment of renewable energies and energy storage.
HE_M_037	39	Yesh Atid is committed to promoting more projects of a national scale.
HE_M_037	40	Including support for the establishment of a strip of solar land in the Gaza Envelope, promotion of renewable energy projects in the Golan Heights, promotion of research and international cooperation for the establishment of wind turbines in the Mediterranean Sea, realization of a project to buy solar electricity from Jordan and more.

IT_005	9	"Through the new Lab, we intend to further expand our collaboration with the dynamic innovation ecosystem in Israel , finding the best solutions for our needs and discovering new opportunities for development, in continuity with the success stories achieved so far through our Open Innovability approach."""
IT_005	10	The Enel AI&Robotics Lab, located in downtown Tel Aviv, provides startups with an area of nearly 300 square meters of open space and meeting rooms in addition to a laboratory area, where they can conduct both office activities and prototyping and testing of small robots, drones and sensors.
IT_005	11	The Lab will support the development of artificial intelligence and robotic technologies, particularly those focused on automation and digitization in renewables and network construction and management, as well as the development of innovative and sustainable materials.
IT_005	12	It will host newly launched startups and offer them technical and commercial validation by providing access to test sites, real data, expert know-how, hardware and software.
IT_005	13	The validation process will include a Proof of Concept (PoC) with the ultimate goal of turning those startups selected by Enel as solution providers into global scale-ups.
IT_005	14	In addition, the Lab will collaborate with local universities, companies, and innovation communities to interact with the Israeli ecosystem, as well as to host workshops and meetings to explore challenges and use cases for which Enel is seeking highly innovative solutions.
IT_005	15	The Lab began operations in June 2022 , hosting its first three-day innovation bootcamp, during which various business and technical challenges were explored and solutions discussed with more than ten startups.
IT_005	16	Future bootcamps will provide opportunities for involved players to work with Enel on numerous challenges, including: automation solutions for the construction of photovoltaic plants to ensure a safe, effective and efficient work environment; ascertainment of worker safety through safe driving and monitoring of risky behaviors in the field; digitization and automation using artificial intelligence techniques and optimization models to validate cutting-edge solutions to support operational processes in the field; innovative solutions for the operation and maintenance of renewable energy plants and distribution networks to increase the number of tasks that can be performed remotely or autonomously (e.g., multifunctional robots, visual analytics models, etc.); use of drones in the utility sector by making use of aerial networks for wireless drone charging.
IT_030	1	Covid, Fauci:
IT_030	2	"""New suspicious variant coming, unlikely to eliminate virus"""
IT_030	3	"It is very ""unlikely"" that Covid will be eliminated and a new 'suspect' variant is on the horizon:"
IT_030	4	thus Anthony Fauci , commented on the trend of contagions with Sars Cov2 and future prospects.
IT_030	5	"Within hours of President Biden's statement-which declared ""the pandemic is over""-his outgoing medical adviser painted a decidedly more worrisome scenario."
IT_030	6	"Speaking to the 'Center for Strategic and International Studies,' Fauci referred to the potentially worrisome Covid BA.2.75.2 mutation and said, ""We are not where we should be, when we say we will have to live with the virus it is because we know we will not eradicate it."""
IT_030	7	"""The real question to be asked,"" he pointed out, ""is whether we will be able to eliminate it from the U.S. and the world, and the answer is that it is unlikely since we are dealing with a highly transmissible virus and the immunity that is produced in the body through vaccines or contagion itself is transient."
IT_030	8	"The director of the U.S. National Institute of Infectious Diseases-who will leave office at the end of December-noted that clearly compared to two years ago ""we are moving in the right direction, but infections are still unacceptably high."""
IT_030	9	"In addition,"" he concluded, ""we will most likely see a new variant emerge in autumn-winter."
IT_030	10	WHO: falling curve of infections.
IT_030	11	In US more deaths.
IT_030	12	And indeed, according to the latest WHO data, more deaths from Covid occurred in the U.S. than in other countries during the week of Sept. 5-11.
IT_030	13	According to data in the World Health Organization (WHO) bulletin, there were 3.1 million new cases of Covid-19 in the week of Sept. 5-11, a 28 percent decrease from the previous week.
IT_030	14	In contrast, the number of deaths fell by 22 percent, with 11,000 deaths reported in one week.
IT_030	15	In the past week, infections fell sharply in all areas of the world: -36 percent in the WHO Western Pacific region, -15 percent in Europe, -27 percent in the Americas, -20 percent in Southeast Asia, -19 percent in the Eastern Mediterranean region, and -33 percent in Africa.
IT_030	16	The same trend was observed for deaths, with the only exception being Africa, where there was a 10 percent increase over last week.
IT_030	17	However, these are very small numbers (57 deaths).
IT_030	18	As for individual countries, the highest number of infections was recorded in Japan (537,181 new cases), followed by South Korea (435,695), the United States (430,048), Russia (337,187) and China (263,288).
IT_030	19	The highest number of deaths occurred in the U.S. (2,306), Japan (1,681), Russia (637), Brazil (551), and the Philippines (440).
IT_030	20	WHO: the end of the pandemic is near.
IT_030	21	On the variant front, BA.5 continues to gain ground and reached 90 percent of virus samples tested, up from 82.4 percent the previous week.
IT_030	22	BA.4, on the other hand, fell from 8 percent to 6.1 percent of the samples, while sub-variant BA.2 and lineages derived from it are on a slight upward climb: BA.2.75 (the so-called Centaurus), in particular, accounts for 2.2 percent of the samples detected in the last week with a doubling from the previous 7 days.
IT_030	23	However, the WHO urges caution in taking variant prevalence data because they are affected by the limitations of surveillance systems at this stage of the pandemic.
IT_030	24	"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus showed optimism: ""We have never been in a better position to end the pandemic."
IT_030	25	"We are not there yet, but the end is at hand."""
IT_032	1	Coronavirus, the bulletin:
IT_032	2	New infections halved, but deaths rise
IT_032	3	Almost halved the number of infections in the last 24: 177 instead of yesterday's 321.
IT_032	4	And new cases in Lombardy also drop precipitously, to 84 from 237.
IT_032	5	But unfortunately, deaths are growing for the second consecutive day, 88 today compared to 71 yesterday and 55 on Tuesday.
IT_032	6	But as repeatedly stated, the death curve is the last to decline in the epidemic, referring to infections several weeks earlier.
IT_032	7	Instead, inpatients in ordinary Covid wards fell sharply, minus 239, while in intensive care units another 15 places were freed up.
IT_032	8	On the upswing in the number of swabs taken, nearly 50,000.
IT_032	9	New cases rose slightly in Piedmont ( +5), Liguria (+ 4) and Emilia Romagna (+ 4).
IT_032	10	Still few, new cases of coronavirus in Veneto, with four infected recorded in the last 24 hours, compared to two yesterday, bringing the total to 19,168.
IT_032	11	The regional bulletin reports 13 deaths since yesterday, including two in hospitals, bringing the total to 1,934.
IT_032	12	Only one new case of coronavirus recorded in Tuscany compared to data released yesterday, when there were 4 cases.
IT_032	13	This brings the total number of infected in the region to 10,122, an increase of 0.01.
IT_032	14	Sadly, there have been four more deaths-one man and three women, average age 89.5 years-bringing the total number of people who have died since the pandemic began to 1,059.
IT_032	15	Cases in Latium rise from 7 to 11 with a cluster identified in Irccs San Raffaele in Rome, raising today's infections in the capital from 5 to 10.
IT_032	16	For the ninth consecutive day, no new confirmed cases of Covid in Umbria, compared with 1,203 swabs analyzed in the last 24 hours.
IT_032	17	There are four new coronavirus infections in Puglia today out of 2,543 swabs processed: one in the province of Bari, one in Brindisi, and two in Lecce.
IT_032	18	In the past two days, there had never been more than one case per day.
IT_032	19	The number of coronavirus victims is still rising: three more deaths were recorded today, two in the province of Bari and one in Tarantino.
IT_032	20	Eighth consecutive day without new Lucanian cases of coronavirus.
IT_032	21	And, with three new recoveries (the total is 352) in Basilicata, the number of people currently positive has dropped from 21 to 18.
IT_032	22	In contrast, Sardinia made it to the third consecutive day without any new Covid-19 positives.
IT_032	23	A total of 1,357 cases have been ascertained since the beginning of the emergency.
IT_032	24	The number of deaths, 131 in all, also remains unchanged.
IT_032	25	Meanwhile, independent monitoring by the GIMBE Foundation confirms in the week of May 28-June 3 both the steady reduction in the burden on hospitals and intensive care units and the further slowdown in infections and deaths.
IT_032	26	In summary: total cases during the week were 2,697 (+1.2%), deaths 529 (+1.6%), inpatients were 1,987 fewer (-25.7%), and those in intensive care decreased by 152 (-30.1%).
IT_034	1	"Lockdown divides virologists, Pregliasco: ""Not now, try to revise parameters."""
IT_034	2	Galli:
IT_034	3	"""In principle Ricciardi is right."""
IT_034	4	Does Italy need a total lockdown right away, as suggested by Walter Ricciardi, adviser to Health Minister Roberto Speranza?
IT_034	5	From a scientific point of view, I agree with Ricciardi with respect to the fact that a drastic closure of 3-4 weeks would nip the Sars-CoV-2 comeback in the bud.
IT_034	6	However, I believe that a total lockdown is difficult to propose from the standpoint of political expediency and the social unrest and rebellion that would be risked.
IT_034	7	That's the view of University of Milan virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco, who has his say in the debate prompted by Ricciardi's statements and immediate wall reactions from some in politics.
IT_034	8	For the expert, better to try a more acceptable way first, try to revise the parameters on which to start the closures.
IT_034	9	"People,"" Pregliasco admits, speaking to Adnkronos Health, ""are tried by the long marathon of zone closures and jerky openings to which the virus has forced us all."
IT_034	10	The results were important, mind you, because the color Italy method has allowed us to date all in all to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.
IT_034	11	We failed to achieve epidemic control, which was the hope with which we started.
IT_034	12	Compared with the pure lockdown, it was only possible to slow down the speed of virus circulation, but let us not forget that in this way the best possible condition was guaranteed for the people who are getting sick, because the current situation sees about 30 percent occupancy of the wards, which is still acceptable.
IT_034	13	"In my opinion,"" Pregliasco then adds, ""perhaps it will be necessary to revise the parameters of openings and closings, to be more flexible."
IT_034	14	Because, you know, when a region goes into the yellow belt, the risk of losing the progress it has made is there.
IT_034	15	Let's see if surgical interventions, red zones like Umbria, will be feasible to be triggered based on more stringent assessments.
IT_034	16	Also on the same page is another virologist, Pier Luigi Lo Palco, now Apulia's Health Councillor: In the fall we managed to manage the wave without lockdowns, but with the still tough lockdown measures.
IT_034	17	The same rigidity would be needed now.
IT_034	18	Certainly, Lopalco resumes, variants are of concern, but it should be stressed that regardless of the variants in the field, restrictive measures should be applied according to the trend of viral spread.
IT_034	19	A possible increase must be matched by a tightening of measures.
IT_034	20	Ricciardi is right in principle, because it is before everyone's eyes that the colored regions thing has worked very poorly without taking us out of the problem.
IT_034	21	This was stated by Massimo Galli, an infectiologist at Sacco Hospital-University of Milan, host of L'aria che tira on La7, commenting on statements by Health Minister Roberto Speranza's adviser Walter Ricciardi, who called for an immediate national lockdown.

IT_037	19	"These commitments need to be followed up."""
IT_037	20	"The premier explained, ""Today's data paint a very different picture than last year."
IT_037	21	The total number of people currently positive for the virus in Italy is 297,000.
IT_037	22	Twelve months ago there were 675,000, despite a much higher level of restrictions.
IT_037	23	The number of people admitted is 8,026.
IT_037	24	On December 14, 2020, there were 30,860.
IT_037	25	In the past seven days there has been an average of 95 deaths per day.

IT_037	30	"These transitory factors should be at least partly overcome during 2022 as consumption normalizes and bottlenecks are overcome,"" Draghi explained."
IT_037	31	"Then he added, ""The price increases also reflect a structural problem with the energy transition."
IT_037	32	The expansion of renewables is still incomplete, partly due to the hesitations of governments in many countries.

IT_054	1	Here's who's funding Ocean Viking: money, the scandal sweeping Europe
IT_054	2	Today, the municipality of Lyon, led by the ecologist mayor Grégory Doucet, will vote on a 14,000-euro grant to the French NGO Sos Méditerranée, owner of the Ocean Viking, that is, the ship that, with 234 migrants on board, has been trying to dock in a European port for several days and is at the center of a diplomatic clash between Rome and Paris.
IT_054	3	The amount released by Lyon's gauche junta will allow NGO volunteers to cover the cost of a day at sea conducting search and rescue operations for migrant boats from Africa.
IT_054	4	It is a duty of humanity, say Doucet and his loyalists, eager to spread a culture of hospitality among the population.
IT_054	5	This is not the first time Lyon has funded Sos Méditerranée.
IT_054	6	"As early as January 2021, the municipality, after joining the association's ""platform of solidarity collectivities,"" awarded it a grant of 28 thousand euros."
IT_054	7	Until 2020, Sos Méditerranée, founded in 2015 by French activist Sophie Beau and former German merchant navy captain Klaus Vogel, operated solely on private funds.
IT_054	8	But then the two founders also appealed to French territorial collectivities, municipalities, departments and regions, to increase activities at sea.
IT_054	9	And the call for help was answered by many.
IT_054	10	CONVENTION Lyon, in fact, is only one of 83 local authorities that have contributed to migrant transport operations to Europe, according to the list on the Sos Méditerranée website.
IT_054	11	The municipality of Paris, led by Socialist Anne Hidalgo, is at the top of the list.
IT_054	12	Hidalgo has morally and ideologically supported all operations of the French NGO since its creation.
IT_054	13	But from 2019, it also supports them financially.
IT_054	14	In fact, the city of Paris releases an annual grant of 100,000 euros earmarked for the migrant rescue association, a grant that will be voted on again at the next city council meeting scheduled for Nov. 15.
IT_054	15	"According to the Boulevard Voltaire website, next week, in addition to the new donation, ""a convention to raise awareness of the situation of migrants among the Parisian public"" will also be signed."
IT_054	16	It should be recalled that Hidalgo, in 2019, had already made headlines for awarding Carola Rackete, the German captain of Sea Watch 3, with the Médaille Grand Vermeil, the Paris municipality's highest honor (in the Socialist junta's communiqué, Carola Rackete was presented as having been persecuted by the Italian justice system).
IT_054	17	Strasbourg, Bordeaux and Grenoble, all led by progressive mayors, have also made contributions to Sos Méditteranée.
IT_054	18	But in addition to the big cities, the French NGO has been able and will be able to count on financial support from as many as nine departments, including Ille-et-Vilaine (50 thousand euros in 2020), Haute-Garonne (100 thousand euros in 2020) and Loire-Atlantique (200 thousand euros in 2020).
IT_054	19	These are joined by the regions Brittany (75,000 euros in 2020), Burgundy (50,000 euros in 2021), Centre-Valley of the Loire (50,000 euros in 2021) and Occitania (75,000 euros in 2020).
IT_054	20	Finally, the central state also played its part.
IT_054	21	"THE SURVEY In February 2017, when the Socialist François Hollande was still in the presidency of the Republic, Sos Méditerranée received the ""great national cause"" label from then-Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve: a fact that allowed it to broadcast its communication campaigns for free on public radio stations and television channels."
IT_054	22	As pointed out by Boulevard Voltaire, which devoted an in-depth study to the shower of public money, thus from taxpayers' pockets, that helps Ocean Viking, far from being neutral, these numerous subsidies fuel illegal immigration (...).
IT_054	23	Regular patrols by Sos Méditerranée ships, some 50 kilometers off the Libyan coast, incite numerous migrants to jump aboard makeshift boats in hopes of being rescued by one of the French NGO's vessels.
IT_054	24	All while the majority of French people are in favor of a sharp reduction in migration flows.
IT_054	25	According to a Csa Institute poll conducted this summer, 71 percent of French citizens are calling for a drastic drop in immigration to their country.
IT_054	26	This includes the newly appointed president of the Rassemblement national, Jordan Bardella, who agrees with the Italian government's hard line: Ms. Meloni says to Macron, 'Since you are so welcoming, now you welcome these people too,' Bardella said yesterday, before adding: I think Ms. Meloni is right to show firmness.
IT_054	27	She is right because that is what she was elected to do.
IT_055	1	The Republic of Prosecutions
IT_055	2	We now live in a judicial republic.
IT_055	3	Founded on the work of some magistrates.
IT_055	4	At this point it would be better to take note and change the Constitution.
IT_055	5	It must be said at the outset that this concerns only a part of the judiciary.
IT_055	6	But being, this part, the most active, we fear that an old economic law applies to it: bad currency drives out the good.
IT_055	7	In recent days Angelo Panebianco in the columns of Corriere della Sera, admirably explained why we have drifted so far.
IT_055	8	In these columns we simply line up some of the latest political and economic events to leave the reader with his or her own considerations.
IT_055	9	The leader of the most important, from a parliamentary point of view, Italian party and that is, drum roll, Luigi Di Maio may have lost a small patrol of senators: four or five.
IT_055	10	For a reason, which is also understandable, the movement he leads voted for what he detested only a few months ago (the bailout fund): but that is another matter.
IT_055	11	Well what does the political leader do?
IT_055	12	He says this could be taken care of by the judicial authority.
IT_055	13	Going on like this, could someone ask Conte, or Salvini, for the reason for the breaking of the government contract and make, I don't know, a civil suit?
IT_055	14	Or a lawsuit for damages?
IT_055	15	The government has decided that the national emergency is not lack of development, or unemployment, but tax evasion.
IT_055	16	Well, to fight it, all that remains is to give more power to magistrates who will be able to arrest, preemptively seize for disproportionality (you read that correctly their power can be disproportionate) and commission (thanks to the strengthening of Law 231) companies.
IT_055	17	Good end for arming prosecutors' offices.
IT_055	18	Besides, the industrialization of this country is also entrusted to them.
IT_055	19	The Taranto prosecutor's office and court decided today to shut down Ilva's blast furnace, and yesterday to seize 1 billion of its finished product (which entailed immense costs) as the body of the crime.
IT_055	20	To mess is added farce: another prosecutor's office has in recent weeks asked Indian tenants not to dare close the same bakery.
IT_055	21	Mittal like Buridan's donkey: he will die, and with him ten thousand employees, not knowing where to turn.
IT_055	22	Prosecutors, and on this many understandably applaud, even adjust our budget policy.
IT_055	23	Let's face it: last year's EU infringement procedure was partly thwarted thanks to the billion that Francesco Greco collected from Gucci's owners.
IT_055	24	Tax arbitrations (rulings, the Anglo-Saxons say) used to be done at the ministry, today at the prosecutor's office.
IT_055	25	Well, then there is the usual question of politics and business.
IT_055	26	Both Renzi and Salvini, two young men who don't have the temperament to have their line dictated by prosecutors, when they raise their heads a bit, zac they are put back in their place.
IT_055	27	The release of the papers on Renzi's mansion bought thanks to a loan immediately repaid (which could have been well spared) is unclear for what reason they were thrown into the public pillory.
IT_055	28	So, raise your hand if you really hold Salvini responsible for kidnapping (and when the ships are offshore as recently happened under the Lamorgese reign?).
IT_055	29	Or that he is a thief for abuse of state aircraft?
IT_055	30	We could go on and on.
IT_055	31	We could cite arrested and released politicians of all political colors (preferably not red), investigations that ended in nothing but were sensational at their inception.
IT_055	32	But these are not the real damages.
IT_055	33	They are the whipped cream.
IT_055	34	What lies underneath is a fearful society, which every day risks making mistakes and being punished, which prefers, if it can, not to do rather than to proceed.
IT_055	35	And an embarrassing political class, which instead of reacting, whines and asks for help from the judiciary, to do some store cleaning.
IT_057	1	Pope Francis guest on Che tempo che fa:
IT_057	2	"""The Mediterranean is the largest cemetery in Europe."""
IT_057	3	Exclusive guest this evening on Che tempo che fa His Holiness Pope Francis.
IT_057	4	Fabio Fazio visibly excited about the live interview.
IT_057	5	We talk about enduring pain and images of suffering seen in the news, especially with the image of a Syrian girl child.
IT_057	6	"The Pope speaks of indifference, recalling Yemen and the country's many years of hardship, but stresses ""they don't count, these people."
IT_057	7	What matters is the war, the sale of weapons.
IT_057	8	With the money from the war he thinks you could give education to the whole world.
IT_057	9	We are used to this, to wars, to children dying in the cold.
IT_057	10	But they are second category; the first category is war.
IT_057	11	What is most important today?
IT_057	12	War.
IT_057	13	"Ideological warfare, commercial ... so many arms factories."""

IT_057	21	Each country must say how many migrants it can take in.
IT_057	22	There is the European Union, you have to get together, in fellowship.
IT_057	23	Now there is injustice, they come to Spain and Italy, they don't get them elsewhere.
IT_057	24	The migrant always should be welcomed, should be accompanied, should be promoted and should be integrated.
IT_057	25	An integrated migrant helps that country.

IT_059	1	Migrants, M5s: those who board barges are desperate, not tourists
IT_059	2	The 5 Star Movement intends to clarify in this note what our country is suffering because of what revolves around NGOs and the migration phenomenon:
IT_059	3	"""On this NGO show, there are some truths that need to be emphasized, because in the frenzy of declarations-more or less disinterested-the goal is often lost."
IT_059	4	But above all, you miss the main point.
IT_059	5	Three truths, let's go in order: 1.
IT_059	6	Those who board a barge with their children to cross the sea are desperate people, not tourists.
IT_059	7	Because he is running away from a war, famine, or a country where he cannot find a future.
IT_059	8	He is not leaving on vacation.
IT_059	9	In the case of Libya, they are fleeing from a war that we did not want and it is good that France, instead of giving lectures, should take responsibility and start taking in these desperate people.
IT_059	10	France and all the countries that Africa has exploited it, impoverished it, devastated it.
IT_059	11	2.
IT_059	12	Another truth is that Italy has already given and now it is good for Europe to move.
IT_059	13	This is not about being left or right.
IT_059	14	This is about being realistic: in the past, the red coops of the PD welcomed to do business and profit on the skin of desperate people, and the NGOs that have provoked our country do no different.
IT_059	15	There may be those who are moved by humanitarian motives, but the question is, who funds these NGOs?
IT_059	16	Who has an interest in visibility?
IT_059	17	Who has an interest in getting Carola Rackete on the covers of major international periodicals?
IT_059	18	All extolling this character of a show, which distracts us and makes us forget regimes, the causes of conflicts abroad and exploitation that cause death, destruction and, therefore, migration flows. 3.
IT_059	19	In the face of all this you can yell all you want, rant all you want, close the ports, but if you don't confiscate their ship these characters go back to marr, maybe to transport migrants they get directly from the boat people, and the spiel starts again.
IT_059	20	We need to stop the ships to put a stop to this media circus.
IT_059	21	We are sick and tired of continuing to talk about these extras and false heroines.
IT_059	22	If you enter Italy and allow yourself to violate our laws, I will immediately take your boat away.
IT_059	23	Period.
IT_059	24	And you never go back to the sea.
IT_059	25	And we finally get back to talking about jobs, employment, our youth, mothers' rights, families.
IT_059	26	Because we do not believe that people in Italy get up in the morning and their first thought is the Carola on duty.

IT_061	8	After announcing the drastic reduction of migrant reception projects, the Carroccio focused on gender theory training in schools.
IT_061	9	The courses, funded with 91,000 euros by the Labor Agency, had been launched in 2014 by the junta of then-governor Ugo Rossi, Fugatti's center-left predecessor.
IT_061	10	Classes had also been planned for 2019 in 24 Trentino institutions, but Councillor Segnana, in agreement with Mirko Bisesti and Achille Spinelli, the heads of Education and Labor, respectively, decided to halt everything.

IT_064	5	Farewell to middle school and reduction of summer vacation:
IT_064	6	here is the school reform according to Matteo Salvini .
IT_064	7	The leader of the League , after headlining the Security decree to curb illegal immigration by armoring Italy's ports and cities law that, now, the yellow government is dismantling piece by piece , is also planning a revolution for the school world.
IT_064	8	In recent days, in fact, the political leader of the Carroccio spoke at a meeting in Capriano Briosco, in the province of Monza and Brianza, and during the evening he talked about the League's ideas and many projects on education.
IT_064	9	"Here, then, is what the former minister of the Interior said, ""We are working to eliminate the three-year middle school hole."
IT_064	10	"No European country has these three years of parking, as well as three months of summer vacation."" In short, the former Viminale titular has clear ideas: to cancel, in the Italian school system, the secondary school, which represents the second level of the first cycle of compulsory education."
IT_064	11	A short and brief parenthesis: compulsory schooling in Italy lasts ten years and covers the age group of 6 to 16 years.
IT_064	12	A plan, this one by Salvini, that is not new.
IT_064	13	In fact, for quite some time, there has been discussion about whether to revise our homegrown school system made up of five years of elementary school, three years of middle school and five years of high school, for a total of 13 years, which some suggest should be reshaped differently.
IT_064	14	The words of the Leghist leader raised a fuss: his plan to cancel the three years of middle school from the age of eleven to fourteen , as well as that of significantly reducing the three months of summer vacation, considered by many observers to be an excessively prolonged period of time (and of detachment from desks and books) for pupils, was publicly opposed by Lucia Azzolina .
IT_064	15	Azzolina, a deputy of the 5 Star Movement , is undersecretary at the Ministry of Education, University and Research.
IT_064	16	"In a rebuttal video posted on Facebook, the Pentastellata commented on Salvini's reform this way, ""Alas, Matteo Salvini misses no opportunity to keep quiet."
IT_064	17	School is not talked about by slogans and the middle school is not a parking lot: teachers, Ata staff, school leaders work there and girls and boys study there.
IT_064	18	It cannot be assumed that all middle schools in Italy are parking lots.
IT_064	19	"I feel embarrassed by these proposals, because school is a serious matter."""
IT_083	1	Coal from Fials: certificates of esteem but only waste paper.
IT_083	2	Stop inequalities between private and public health care
IT_083	3	The private health care sector and especially the workers and professionals of nursing homes, members of AIOP as well as ARIS, have been waiting for more than 15 years for a contract renewal that has been announced several times and never implemented, even if a pre-agreement signature has been reached, it seems to be a waste paper since it is tied exclusively to funding to be provided by individual regions.
IT_083	4	In a polemical tone begins Giuseppe Carbone, FIALS General Secretary, who poses a sharp dissent to the disgraceful dragging of the employer parties who, after the numerous attestations of esteem shown to all health workers in the long weeks of the Covid emergency, now show a total disregard for their workers such as to ghettoize them, compared to their colleagues in public health, without the normative and legal issues of the contractual renewal freeze and for this even more serious and damaging to their dignity, human and professional.
IT_083	5	In commending the responsibility taken by AIOP President Barbara Cittadini in signing a pre-agreement despite some vetoes shown within its own National Council, FIALS is not content and is spokesperson for the rights of private health care employees in a note to the President of the Conference of Regions, Stefano Bonaccini, to the effect that the Regions keep the commitments made with AIOP and ARIS, in agreement with the Minister of Health, Roberto Speranza, to shoulder 50 percent of the costs of the contractual renewal, with structural intervention and at the same time, on budgets and rates, or in any case, in other ways agreed upon.
IT_083	6	At the moment, the FIALS leader continues, we understand that only one region, Veneto, has issued a resolution to this effect while all the others only make announcements and verbal assurances that as is well known if they have a grip in the area of political politicking, especially at the time of regional elections as is happening in Puglia, Campania, Liguria, Marche, Tuscany and Valle d'Aosta, certainly do not determine the esteem of the workers but only their disgust and non-voting response.
IT_083	7	In ending his wish for a more concrete and truthful policy, Carbone appealed to Minister Speranza, as well as Minister Boccia, to intensify in this week the commitments made and intervene directly on all the Regions to issue their resolutions of financial commitments, before the regional elections, to the AIOP and ARIS nursing homes and to immediately start the just and rightful recognition of private health care workers of the national labor contract that, among other things, does not fully recognize economically all their professional efforts and skills.
IT_085	1	Evening dress is made of CO2
IT_085	2	A black evening dress made from a fabric that uses carbon monoxide emissions, thus taking them out of the atmosphere.
IT_085	3	It is Zara's new proposal , a limited edition, for now only online.
IT_085	4	In this way, Inditex , the brand owner, intends to emphasize its commitment to the environment.
IT_085	5	The project is the result of a collaboration between the Spanish company and LanzaTech , a company dedicated to recycling and specifically that of carbon.
IT_085	6	Using Carbon Smart technology, emissions from a Chinese steel mill are transformed , through microbial fermentation, into a polyester fiber.
IT_085	7	The process is similar to that employed in breweries.
IT_085	8	The gas is captured and, thanks to bacteria, becomes ethanol called Lanzanol.
IT_085	9	With the cooperation of other partners such as India Glycols Limited it is in turn converted to monoethylene glycol and then to polyester .
IT_085	10	This material has another positive feature: at the end of its life it can be collected, reprocessed and recycled into other clothes.
IT_085	11	It is not exclusive.
IT_085	12	In fact, Lanza tech also collaborates with other manufacturers.
IT_085	13	A Canadian sporting goods company, Lululemon , is using carbon polyester to create yoga pants.
IT_085	14	The shoe manufacturer On has adopted it for the foam of its running models.
IT_085	15	Swiss Migros would like to replace plastic in bottles, cups and containers for household cleaning formulas.
IT_085	16	Unilever and L'Oreal are also considering introducing it into their lines.
IT_085	17	The fashion industry is now in the crosshairs.
IT_085	18	It contributes 10 percent of global emissions, more than airlines and shipping, much of which is due precisely to disposable fashion.
IT_085	19	In addition, there is the problem of waste Each European citizen throws away an average of 11 kilograms of clothes each year , most of which are then burned or end up in landfills.
IT_085	20	Only 1 percent are recycled.
IT_085	21	Zara, one of the world's largest brands, produces 800 million clothes each year, mostly made of polyester .
IT_085	22	This fiber is one of the largest contributors to microplastic pollution of the oceans, most of which is not from production but from household washing.
IT_085	23	And, in soil, it takes more than 200 years to degrade, without ever doing so completely.
IT_085	24	Affordable price for all and the ever-changing proposition have certainly encouraged overconsumption.
IT_085	25	However, the initiative underscores a growing commitment to sustainability.
IT_085	26	Last year Zara had also launched the Join Life label for garments made from sustainable materials, is organizing the collection of discarded clothing to donate to aid organizations, and is researching the use of recycled materials.
IT_085	27	He also set a goal of achieving zero emissions by 2040.
IT_085	28	Unfortunately, as attractive a proposition as this is, the environmental impact is not completely eliminated: in fact, only 20 percent of the polyester is monoethylene glycol.
IT_085	29	The remaining 80% is purified terephthalic acid, and comes from fossils.
IT_092	1	Whatsapp, son's photo on parents' chat.
IT_092	2	And the complaint is triggered
IT_092	3	In the age of the Internet and Whatsapp, it may happen that one parent decides to sue another for aggravated defamation against their 11-year-old son.
IT_092	4	It all came about because of a photo of the little boy showing him raising his middle finger in class.
IT_092	5	Certainly not a pretty picture, but that would have been the end of it if a father had not decided to post the image on the parents' class chat on Whatsapp, complete with a comment:
IT_092	6	. Open sky.
IT_092	7	After a heated argument between parents, the complaint was triggered.
IT_092	8	But let's go in order.
IT_092	9	From a photo to a complaint.
IT_092	10	According to a report in Il Resto del Carlino , it all began about ten days ago in Bologna, when a photo of the boy carrying out the ominous act was placed in the chat room of parents of pupils attending sixth grade.
IT_092	11	As can be guessed by looking at the background, the protagonist is in the classroom, during a lecture.
IT_092	12	Also in the wrong perhaps was the photographer who should not have kept his cell phone on in the courtroom.
IT_092	13	Or at least that is the ban in many schools.
IT_092	14	The fact is that the photo in question is first exchanged between pupils and then also reaches the parent who decides to post it in the adult chat, accompanied by comment The photo cannot be removed from Whatsapp.
IT_092	15	As soon as the little boy's mother realizes that the one being immortalized is her own child, she immediately demands that the photo be removed, as no one has the right to run pictures of minors without permission.
IT_092	16	The woman finds several mothers by her side, but not the accusing parent who refuses to do so on the grounds that she is on a private chat.
IT_092	17	And that the mother had better get angry with her son.
IT_092	18	After likening the mother's behavior to that of the 11-year-old, the parent exited the chat, leaving the virtual group forever.
IT_092	19	Even if you wanted to, the photo can no longer be removed now, either because the person who posted it is no longer part of the chat or because the period in which it can be done has passed.
IT_092	20	The parents of the immortalized boy repeatedly tried to call the other father, who never answered, and eventually had their phone numbers permanently blocked.
IT_092	21	At this point they decided to take legal action and sue the man for aggravated defamation of a minor, on a chat room with more than thirty adult members.
IT_092	22	Matteo Murgo, the attorney for the family of the boy in the photo, stressed that
IT_092	23	"""this of cell phones being used lightly in the classroom by very young kids is a widespread problem."
IT_092	24	"My clients are ready to join as civil parties in any trial, seeking compensation for moral and material damages suffered."""

IT_104	4	This was the outcome of a conference organized by Confcommercio , with the participation of ENEA , where the signing of a memorandum of understanding for sustainable development was also announced.
IT_104	5	New areas at risk in ENEA report The level of the Mediterranean Sea is rising rapidly due to global warming and, according to ENEA projections, by 2100 thousands of square kilometers of Italian coastal areas are at risk of being submerged by the sea , due to a sea i n rise estimated at about 1 meter and even more (between 0.94 and 1.035 meters with the precautionary model and between 1.31 meters and 1.45 meters on a less conservative basis).
IT_104	6	The rising phenomenon affects virtually all Italian regions washed by the sea for a total of 40 coastal areas at risk of flooding : not only the Adriatic areas of Trieste, Venice and Ravenna, but also the area of Pescara, Lesina (Foggia) and Taranto in Apulia; on the Tyrrhenian side, areas at risk range from La Spezia in Liguria, down to Tuscany (Versilia, Cecina, Follonica, Piombino) and Marina di Campo on Elba Island, but also the mouth of the Tiber River in Lazio, the Pontine plain of Fondi and the Volturno and Sele plains in Campania; many areas at risk in Sardinia (Cagliari and Oristano) and Sicily, including the Aeolian Islands.
IT_104	7	Adding up the area of the 15 coastal zones already mapped in detail results in a total flood risk area of 5,686.4 square kilometers , equal to a region like Liguria.
IT_104	8	Need to Save the Sea Economy The blue economy, or the complex ledi activities related directly or indirectly to the sea resource, includes nearly 200 thousand enterprises , including fishing, shipbuilding, maritime transport, tourism and research activities, accounting for 3.2 percent of the total.
IT_104	9	This is revealed by Confcommercio, according to which this sector produces about 3 percent of GDP and employs more than 880 thousand people , with growth dynamics in recent years well above those of the entire economy.
IT_104	10	Moreover, if we consider that every euro generated directly by the industry activates about two more on the national economy, we arrive at an added value produced by the entire industry of 130 billion euros per year and close to 10 percent of the total economy.
IT_104	11	Hence the importance of infrastructure planning and maintenance , which is still an underestimated issue in Italy.
IT_104	12	The effects of global warming assessed in sustainable and resilient infrastructure planning should, therefore, be considered within the more general and ambitious process of integrating policies on infrastructure and transportation with those on environment and energy.
IT_104	13	Confcommercio-ENEA Memorandum of Understanding on Sustainable Development Signed The Memorandum of Understanding signed today by the President of Confcommercio, Carlo Sangalli , and the President of ENEA, Federico Testa , aims to carry out research, training, information and analysis activities for the 'efficient use of resources and energy redevelopment through the integration of their respective competencies.
IT_104	14	The four-year agreement aims to encourage the definition and implementation of joint projects and actions in strategic sectors for urban and territorial development, with particular attention to environmental sustainability, also from a tourism perspective The collaboration will also cover energy diagnosis and upgrading activities and support in the drafting of calls for proposals and the procurement of financing.
IT_104	15	The agreement also aims to foster the transition to a circular economy model , including the waste cycle, sustainable water resource management and recovery of raw materials from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE).
IT_104	16	Within this framework, ENEA is committed to providing human resources, technologies and services, supporting Confcommercio for training and information activities, and sharing useful expertise to identify needs and opportunities for technological innovation.
IT_110	1	Europe, where does the government stand on sovereignty?
IT_110	2	President Meloni, in her inaugural speech, pointed to a new approach with Europe, identifying a coincidence between integration and national interests.
IT_110	3	Then again, between the more than 200 billion to be managed from the Next Generation and the European Central Bank, which has so far purchased 363 billion in Italian government debt, there is no other choice.
IT_110	4	Europe is now the indispensable setting of a community of destiny to which we belong with our other continental partners.
IT_110	5	And the happy decision to entrust a competent and experienced personality like Raffaele Fitto with the Ministry of European Affairs seems consistent with this new choice of field.
IT_110	6	One then wonders whether in his Party the Constitutional Bill presented in the last legislature by the deputies of Fratelli d'Italia with Giorgia Meloni herself as the first signatory can now be considered completely outdated.
IT_110	7	It provided for the amendment of Article 117, in conjunction with Article 11, which establishes the primacy of European Union law over domestic law, consequently entrusting compliance with it to the binding case law of the European courts.
IT_110	8	That proposal, moreover from 2018, was based on the need to recover the principle of national sovereignty vis-à-vis the European Union order, which could operate only insofar as it was compatible with it.
IT_110	9	Thus, it was intended to question an essential aspect for the functioning of the entire European system, namely that of uniform (but not necessarily identical) legal regulation of the policies and subjects covered by the Treaty.
IT_110	10	The consequence would be the end of the entire EU.
IT_110	11	In fact, the alleged preservation of national sovereignty in the current framework makes little sense.
IT_110	12	In fact, on the one hand, Italy's participation in the process of European integration did not entail any cession of sovereignty (as evidenced by the possibility of its exit, see the United Kingdom) but rather the delegation of the exercise of a plurality of competencies (through the principle of attribution) deemed more effectively expendable in the supranational arena from the consideration of the supra-emptying of national markets.
IT_110	13	What is more, as the years have passed, a plurality of problems and interests have increasingly emphasized the absence of boundaries (environment, economy, energy and water resources, terrorism and organized crime, health) with the consequence of the impossibility of concentrating ultimate authority and regulatory monopoly in the one national source, a concentration certainly at the expense of effective exercise of sovereign powers that would remain only formal and apparent.
IT_110	14	The very functioning of the EU institutions is strongly placed to protect individual state sovereignty given that in many major matters unanimity is required for the adoption of normative acts and that, where a majority is expected, there are additional procedures for reflection before sanctioning their effectiveness.
IT_110	15	Moreover, remembering that the source of the entire system remains an international treaty, even its amendment is always subject not only to the necessary signature of the respective governments but, moreover, to ratification (parliamentary or referendum) by each member state.
IT_110	16	In a system where each Member's veto power is well in place there is far too much national sovereignty!
IT_110	17	By the petitioners, this recovery was also justified with reference to a wholly superficial and improper reading of the rulings of some constitutional courts, including that of Germany.
IT_110	18	When we talk about recovering sovereignty we forget that, on the contrary, it was precisely through the sharing of sovereignty that Italy managed to save itself from economic and social bankruptcy.
IT_110	19	In fact, the principle of solidarity is the raison d'être of integration, and we have made ample use of it; sovereignism is its opposite.
IT_110	20	It is good to remember this clearly.
IT_110	21	And then, has the national interest not been protected?
IT_110	22	In fact it now coincides with the European one as, moreover, now indicated by President Meloni herself in her inauguration speech.
IT_110	23	Certainly, the primacy of EU law cannot be exercised at the expense, moreover hypothetical, of the inviolable principles of our legal system.
IT_110	24	The justification for the constitutional amendment, in conclusion, was related for the petitioners to the need to better protect the Italian people, its Parliament and its powers.
IT_110	25	But it cannot forget that we are now twinned with 26 other peoples in a democratic and legislative body called the European Parliament in expression of the second citizenship possessed by each of us, the European one.
IT_110	26	It too is an expression and guarantor of sovereign peoples, including our own.
IT_124	1	"Government crisis, Stockholm: ""The League will come out stronger."
IT_124	2	"Italy with the Viségrad countries."""
IT_124	3	"""If lItaly goes to the polls we think the League will come out stronger, because Salvini in his own way talks about things that people want to hear, and we doubt that the Pd and the Fifteen will know how to do as much as we Nordic social democrats in government here in Sweden, Denmark and Finland have learned:"
IT_124	4	"austerity on migrants, growth and inclusive social and economic policy."""
IT_124	5	The man talking on his cell phone behind the tinted windows of the large black armored Volvo in which he is shuttling these hours between the headquarters of Swedish Social Democracy and Rosenbad, the government building, does not want to be mentioned by name but is Stockholm's highest source, the top European and foreign policy adviser to the Social Democratic prime minister and foreign minister, Stefan Lofven and Margot Wallström.
IT_124	6	He analyzes everything, studies every report from embassies, friendly parties, political scientists and the experts from Säpo, the secret police.
IT_124	7	"""Italy could become the fifth and by far the strongest heavyweight and most important country in the Viségrad Group,"" points out the Swedish gray eminence, ""and we understand that Orbán in Hungary and PiS in Poland are hoping for this, and from a distance Trump is too."
IT_124	8	The sovereignists want to change Europe from within with strong national powers and hard line and perhaps as in Hungary and Poland with the judiciary under executive control.
IT_124	9	"We Nordic social democrats are the opposite example and will become even more than today the target of their every attack, we are going toward hard political confrontations and clashes in the EU: it is either us and Macron or them."""
IT_124	10	"Pessimism and skepticism dominate on the Italian left in the power-leadership of the Great North, exposed with its sister countries of the Nordic Community (Denmark Finland, plus Iceland and Norway outside the EU) ""to both the military provocations and political meddling of Putin's friend Salvini and Orbán and the slanders of the sovereignists who absurdly paint us as no go areas in the hands of rapist and criminal migrants."""
IT_124	11	"""The Pd, it seems to us, does not have a clear policy of strict immigration control accompanied by clear ideas for growth, youth, employment, unlike us, the new social democratic premier Mette Frederiksen or the Swedish social democratic premier Antti Rinne."
IT_124	12	"This the voters see, so we do not believe that Pd and M5S can make a majority."""
IT_124	13	"Accents of concern: ""LEuropa cannot loseItaly, and at the same time we know that the sovereignists know very well what they want, they are quite different from theultrad-right of the 1980s and 1990s."""
IT_124	14	Such a trend may strengthen the populists here as well, and it just so happens that they too (the SverigeDemokraterna led by young Jimmie Akesson, ed. ) are no longer talking about leaving the EU but about an EU with increasingly strong populist and sovereignist forces.
IT_124	15	"On their side they have Donald Trump, and every autocratic and anti-European firing from Washington, and every initiative of Orbán or Kaczynski against Europe wanted by Macron, Berlin or us will gain much more weight if supported by a future government of one of Europe's major industrial and political powers, Italy,"" our interlocutor adds."
IT_124	16	"He insists, ""These will be times of very tough battles, and extreme tensions between the Northern Europe of the pragmatic left, hard on migrants and pro-growth and pro-Europe with Macron and Germany on their side, and them."
IT_124	17	They paint us as a failure, it is absurd and you can tell by looking at how many rejections we implement and what records of growth excellence employment and welfare we have, but the confrontation will be tough and inevitable.
IT_124	18	"It will certainly not be a favorable framework for progress of any kind in European integration."""
IT_126	1	Syria, Damascus army captures Saraqib: civilian casualties.
IT_126	2	Refugee influx increases
IT_126	3	As forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al Assad advance into the northwestern province of Idlib, the last rebel enclave in the Arab country, the exodus of refugees to the nearby Turkish border, where already hundreds of thousands live in camps without water or power, has continued.
IT_126	4	The Damascus regime's army has just captured Saraqib, a strategic town just southeast of Idlib, at the end of weeks of shelling and fighting against jihadist and insurgent groups, resulting in numerous civilian casualties as well.
IT_126	5	Meanwhile, on the border of this province that had a population of 1 million before the war and now because of those who fled the areas recaptured by the loyalist army has 3 million, Turkey has increased its military presence.
IT_126	6	It has sent more than 200 armored vehicles to the area, ready for action, following clashes in recent days with the Syrian president's troops.
IT_126	7	Ankara operates 12 checkpoints in the area, which the Turkish Defense Ministry says will continue to be operational.
IT_126	8	Two days ago, the check-points had been reinforced with the arrival of men, armored vehicles and medium-range guns from the neighboring Turkish province of Reyhanli, after a Syrian regime bombardment on Feb. 3 resulted in the deaths of seven military personnel and one Turkish civilian.
IT_126	9	Despite an agreement between Turkey and Russia to demilitarize the area, the Damascus army, backed by Moscow's air force, launched a violent offensive in December to retake control of the province.
IT_126	10	Offensive that is not sparing the civilian population, with more than 600,000 refugees fleeing to the Turkish border.
IT_126	11	Assad's troops, with Putin's air support, are bombing houses, hospitals, factories and tent cities thus preventing any chance of life and terrorizing civilians to force them to flee.
IT_126	12	Yesterday, meanwhile, Turkish presidential spokesman Fahrettin Altun said that the wave of refugees, caused by the Damascus forces' offensive in the province, could reach all the way to Europe: if the process, which has started just across our borders, is not stopped immediately, a new and larger influx of refugees will begin, eventually reaching European capitals.
IT_126	13	Erdogan already hosts 3.5 million Syrian refugees and has repeatedly said he is not willing to take in more.
IT_126	14	Now, if Damascus troops were to recapture Idlib, Turkey would overflow at least 1.8 million people, according to a UN estimate.
IT_126	15	Finally, also yesterday, Iran said it was ready to mediate between Turkey and Syria.
IT_126	16	This was made known by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Mohammad Javad Zarif, stressing that the Syrian crisis must be resolved through diplomacy, and adding that civilians in Syria should not be used as human shields.
IT_127	1	Soleimani killed on Trump's orders Tehran threat:
IT_127	2	"""Prepare the coffins."""
IT_127	3	Qassem Soleimani was leaving Baghdad airport by car.
IT_127	4	He was hit by a barrage of missiles fired by U.S. drones near a loading dock.
IT_127	5	The commander of the Iranian Pasdaran Special Forces had flown in from Lebanon or Syria.
IT_127	6	One of his many trips to the region.
IT_127	7	He did not expect the U.S. blitz.
IT_127	8	With him was the leader of the Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah militia, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, one of his students who died with him, along with six others, including also his son-in-law and a member of the Lebanese Hezbollah.
IT_127	9	For Washington, Soleimani was responsible for the Dec. 28 attack that killed a U.S. civilian contractor at a base near Kirkuk.
IT_127	10	But this is not just another targeted killing.
IT_127	11	It marks a major escalation of tensions between Washington and Tehran.
IT_127	12	Soleimani, the 62-year-old silver-haired general who liked to wear an Arab-style ring on his ring finger, was a hero to his fighters.
IT_127	13	He was Iran's most powerful military figure, the country's real foreign minister.
IT_127	14	Believed to be the strategic mastermind of Iran's projection throughout the Middle East.
IT_127	15	From Lebanon to Iraq, Syria and Yemen via the Revolutionary Guard al Quds Forces.
IT_127	16	As commander of elite special forces, he organized and directed covert operations, coordinating proxy militias throughout the region.
IT_127	17	He was considered the second most powerful figure in Iran after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
IT_127	18	U.S. President Donald Trump, who was in Florida at the time of the raid, tweeted an image of the American flag shortly after the attack.
IT_127	19	He added: With the strong man eliminated, Iran has never won a war.
IT_127	20	The Pentagon clarified that Soleimani was developing plans to attack U.S. diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.
IT_127	21	This raid aims to deter future Iranian attack plans, he added.
IT_127	22	The United States has called the commanders of the al Quds Forces terrorists and holds them responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq.
IT_127	23	Washington fears retaliation, has reduced diplomatic staff, and even oil company employees have been asked to leave the country.
IT_127	24	Oil prices have risen more than 4 percent in global markets.
IT_127	25	The attack comes days after protesters attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
IT_127	26	The Pentagon claims Soleimani supported the assault.
IT_127	27	Meanwhile, criticism of the U.S. operation is beginning to rise.
IT_127	28	Khamenei, declared revenge for criminals.
IT_127	29	He also announced three days of national mourning.
IT_127	30	Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, called the murder an act of international terrorism, tweeting that the United States is responsible for all the consequences of its rogue adventurism.
IT_127	31	The U.S. must start buying coffins for its soldiers, said instead Deputy Chief of the Revolutionary Guards Mohammad Reza Naghdi.
IT_127	32	And Soleimani's successor Esmail Qaani reiterates we will see dead Americans throughout the region.
IT_127	33	President Hassan Rohani also used threatening tones.
IT_127	34	Iran and other free nations in the region will retaliate for this gruesome crime of criminal America.
IT_127	35	Other comments were not slow to arrive as well.
IT_127	36	Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi condemned the assassination as a dangerous escalation of regional tensions.
IT_127	37	Russia said the attack was a reckless step.
IT_127	38	The Hezbollah group in Lebanon demanded revenge.
IT_127	39	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the United States has the right to defend itself and praised President Trump for acting swiftly and decisively.
IT_127	40	Analysts in the region such as Aaron David Miller, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, do not hide concern.
IT_127	41	It is one of the most consequence-laden killings in the Middle East in recent years and will have violent implications primarily for the United States, Iran and Israel.
IT_127	42	He concluded: There is a risk of a real war between the three countries.
IT_127	43	Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Tehran in a demonstration protesting U.S. crimes.
IT_127	44	And the U.S. Embassy in Iraq urged all its citizens to leave the country immediately.

IT_133	3	A man with a Kalashnikov opened fire near the intelligence headquarters.
IT_133	4	Early reports are that three officers are dead.
IT_133	5	Neutralized all attackers.
IT_133	6	Three are the victims of an attack carried out by a man in central Moscow near the Russian intelligence headquarters.
IT_133	7	These were three agents of the FSB, the Russian security service.
IT_133	8	This was reported by the Moscow Times.
IT_133	9	Armed with an assault rifle, a man opened fire in front of the Federal Security Services headquarters on Lubyanka Square.
IT_133	10	"Three, according to initial rumors, the victims In the shooting two people were hit, "" a security forces source told the Moskva news agency The attacker, currently unidentified, allegedly used a Kalashnikov and after the shooting fled to a nearby street to barricade himself in a building located on Bolshaja Lubjanka Street."
IT_133	11	But the man would not act alone.
IT_133	12	According to the Moscow Times , there were allegedly three attackers.
IT_133	13	Two of the three men who attacked the FSB headquarters were killed shortly afterward by security forces, while a third, the killer of the officers, reportedly managed to escape to a nearby parking lot.
IT_133	14	"Russian security services later claimed to have "" neutralized"" him."
IT_133	15	Now law enforcement officials are trying to trace his identity.
IT_133	16	According to an Rbk source , the man allegedly started shooting during an intelligence reception and then ran out into the street.
IT_133	17	For other media, however, the shooting reportedly began in Vorovskogo Square.
IT_133	18	The attack on the security service headquarters in Moscow occurred on the anniversary of the birth of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police created in 1917 by Lenin, which later became the KGB and then the FSB.
IT_133	19	At the time of the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin was giving just such an address to the intelligence community, but it is unclear whether or not the Kremlin chief was within walking distance of the struck headquarters.
IT_133	20	Automatic weapons are being fired in central Moscow.
IT_133	21	But don't worry, the damn nineties are long gone Alexei Navalny commented on Twitter , the blogger who is antagonistic to President Putin, mocking what happened in the center of the Russian capital.
IT_133	22	The reference to the 1990s is a critical message to the Kremlin leader, who has always made it a boast of his presidency to have ended the chaos that marked that decade in Russia.
IT_140	1	A hacker in charge of the Inps (it's about time)
IT_140	2	On April 1, the Inps web platform collapsed miserably as thousands of people tried to access it to claim the 600-euro covid bonus.
IT_140	3	The private data of a large number of citizens were published in error.
IT_140	4	"Then the top management of the Inps instead of taking responsibility for the disaster blamed ""the hackers"": they attacked us, they said; it was not totally unfounded but no one believed them."
IT_140	5	A little more than eight months have passed, and at the head of the digital transformation of the most important public entity we have comes a young hacker, one of the best we have: his name is Vincenzo Di Nicola, he is 41 years old, from Abruzzo, but for many years he has been shuttling to Silicon Valley where he has cashed in remarkable successes: the most notable, having sold his startup's technology on payments through smartphones to Jeff Bezos, to Amazon.
IT_140	6	Then he returned briefly to Italy, said he wanted to give something back to his country; he returned just long enough to co-found one of the best startups in cryptocurrency, Conio, a platform that makes it super easy to buy and sell bitcoin.
IT_140	7	I last heard from him in late 2020 just to talk about Conio's achievements after seven years of toil.
IT_140	8	In early January, the turning point: from bitcoin to Inps, the leap backward is big.
IT_140	9	"""I couldn't resist the call of civil service,"" he wrote on his blog, citing his father, who worked at the registry office in his hometown of Teramo, and his mother, who went from the telegraph office to the Post Office counter."
IT_140	10	Because of this sentimental connection with the public administration, when the Inps sank on April 1 he wrote a very harsh post i n which he explained in detail the errors and waste (half a billion euros over several years for a sieve platform).
IT_140	11	But instead of just attacking Vincenzo he called on the top leadership of the INPS to do as Obama did when the highly anticipated U.S. government health care platform sank at its debut, instead of blaming the hackers, he called the best hackers in the country to the White House who quickly got it back on its feet.
IT_140	12	"""We also need an Operation Impetus and Storm from us,"" he wrote romantically."
IT_140	13	At the Inps they must have read that post but instead of being offended they started looking for a new chief of innovation and finally chose him, Vincenzo Di Nicola, who had left Abruzzo for Silicon Valley after high school but then dropped everything and came back to help out.
IT_140	14	He now has three years and a very complicated and crucial task ahead of him: if he can get even the Inps to go digital, no one will have any excuses.
IT_140	15	Daje.
IT_141	1	Who wins between the Kremlin and the West?
IT_141	2	For Yale:
IT_141	3	"""Sanctions are catastrophically crippling the Russian economy."""
IT_141	4	Who wins in the economic war?
IT_141	5	West or Russia?
IT_141	6	Putin's strategy is to bend Ukraine with arms in a protracted confrontation of friction.
IT_141	7	The other lever is mainly gas: Russia shutting off the taps raises the cost of supporting Ukraine, hoping that the public opinions of the allies will sooner or later give in to the aggressor's bullying.
IT_141	8	The danger indeed is serious: a complete supply cut would send several EU countries into recession (for us -2% of GDP in 2023, according to a Bank of Italy estimate).
IT_141	9	And in the meantime, many analysts point out, Kremlin revenues remain respectable due to high oil and gas prices.
IT_141	10	In fact an immediate crash of the economy was avoided.
IT_141	11	"So much so that a newspaper like the Economist wrote: Russia's recession may be ""surprisingly mild."""
IT_141	12	But in fact it is fairly widely agreed that Russia is suffering-and a lot of it, too-because of sanctions.
IT_141	13	Its industry needs inputs coming from abroad, without which there is a structural weakening of productive capacity, including military.
IT_141	14	Then it is true that China and India are important alternatives to the European market, but they buy at discounted prices by taking advantage of Russian isolation.
IT_141	15	So what is really happening?
IT_141	16	Yale University tries to take stock of the situation.
IT_141	17	"It has just released a 118-page document calling it ""one of the first comprehensive analyses assessing current Russian economic activity and its future prospects five months after the start of the invasion."""
IT_141	18	"The authors say they used ""private Russian-language sources and unconventional data-including high-frequency consumer data, complex shipment data, and information from Russia's international trading partners."""
IT_141	19	"In light of all this, the authors continue, it can be said that sanctions and the flight of multinationals and foreign companies ""are catastrophically crippling the Russian economy."""
IT_141	20	"By isolating itself from foreign business, according to Yale researchers, ""Russia has lost companies that account for about 40 percent of its GDP, which has disrupted three decades of foreign investment and reinforced a simultaneous and unprecedented flight of population and capital in a mass exodus of the economic base."""
IT_141	21	"To deal with this crisis, Putin is resorting to ""patently unsustainable"" fiscal and monetary measures that would have ""already sent the state budget into deficit for the first time in years and drained foreign reserves despite high commodity prices."""
IT_141	22	"According to the paper, ""the Kremlin's finances are in much, much worse shape than conventionally thought."""
IT_141	23	Then Yale also takes stock of the Asian turnaround in energy exports.
IT_141	24	As has been said many times, Russia has been increasing sales to Russia and China to compensate for the gradual loss of the Western, particularly European, market.
IT_141	25	But all of this, Yale says, takes place in a disadvantageous negotiating position - because Russia, isolated, is forced to accept heavy discounts in order to sell.
IT_141	26	"And so, the report continues, ""Russia's strategic positioning as a commodity exporter has irrevocably deteriorated."
IT_141	27	"Russia and China are notoriously price-conscious buyers who maintain close ties with other major commodity exporters."""
IT_141	28	"For Russia, in essence, ""there is no way out of economic oblivion."""
IT_141	29	"Provided, however, that the allied countries ""remain united in maintaining and increasing sanctions pressure."""
IT_141	30	And this is where Putin crosses his fingers: his people are far more accustomed to abuse and deprivation than rich Western democracies.
IT_143	1	Women in Finance - When finance is a woman
IT_143	2	Against the backdrop of strong change that is seeing a greater focus on equal opportunity within companies and institutions, Le Fonti TV is dedicating a format to women in business.
IT_143	3	Women in Finance is the new format airing on Le Fonti TV, every Friday at 10:30 am.
IT_143	4	A format that gives space to the role and professionalism of women, key players in the world of work in all sectors.
IT_143	5	The format aims to be a meeting space with leading women in the world of finance, trading, business, entrepreneurship and consulting.
IT_143	6	"Talented women in an industry, such as finance, that is predominantly male-dominated, where the so-called glass ceiling often hinders women who want to advance their careers and where clichés still lead people to think that finance is a ""man's thing."""
IT_143	7	It is no coincidence that on the executive committees of hedge found companies, for example, the average female representation is 9 percent.
IT_143	8	In Italy but also in the rest of Europe, there are still very few women in the role of CEO (7 percent of the total) or CFO (14 percent, according to Credit Suisse Gender 3000 data).
IT_143	9	With Women in Finance, conceived and hosted by Annabella D'Argento, live on Fridays at 10:30 a.m. on Le Fonti TV, the values of diversity are promoted by meeting female professionals who inspire change starting with women themselves.
IT_143	10	"""In our country, lagging behind in the rankings on the level of financial literacy and where there is an important gender differential between men and women, there is a need for training in economics and finance ""Women in Finance"" wants to be an educational and awareness-raising tool that goes towards a change in society,"" comments Annabella D'Argento."
IT_143	11	It must be said that there is an evolution taking place and many companies are making efforts to foster gender equality by focusing on enhancing the skills of their employees.
IT_143	12	"""Women in Finance"" is intended to tell all this."
IT_143	13	To date, the format boasts the participation of a rich parterre of female professionals who have shared their testimonies and experiences: Claudia Segre (Founder of Global Thinking Foundation), Alessandra Pasini (CFO of SNAM), Elena Sanjust di Teulada (trader coach), Maurizia Cacciatori (former volleyball player), Elsa Fornero (economist, former Minister of Labor and Social Policies, with responsibility for equal opportunities), Francesca Luisa Bianchi (Business coach), Paola Migliorino (Borsari Publisher and analyst), Anna Resti Bontoi (trader), Valentina Proietti Muzi (financial and wealth consultant), Giusi Ferrario (life coach, metamedicine consultant and psychopedagogist), Gaela Bernini (Bracco Foundation), Nadia Linciano (Consob) and many others.
IT_143	14	Woman in Finance can be seen live every Friday at 10:30 a.m. on Le Fonti TV network ( www.lefonti.tv ), the live streaming TV dedicated to business.
IT_143	15	The TV format will also find its way into the pages of trade magazines published by Le Fonti.
IT_143	16	Integration and multi-channels have always been a key factor in communication, and for this reason from the very beginning, Le Fonti has structured its editorial developments by involving the different media of which it is the publisher: print, web, TV and events are used synergistically for effective and pervasive communication capable of reaching target audiences in a timely manner.
IT_143	17	The Sources TVThe Sources TV is the first true live streaming television.
IT_143	18	Born in the heart of Milan, the television station quickly managed to establish itself in the financial, economic and legal information scene.
IT_143	19	With a programming schedule full of thematic appointments and timely and rigorous information, Le Fonti TV follows the main economic and political news at the international level live on a daily basis, giving an unbiased interpretation and highlighting its impact on different sectors and business.

IT_156	1	Pensions, INPS:
IT_156	2	Nearly 22.8 million benefits active in 2021, annual spending over 313 billion
IT_156	3	As of December 31, 2021, there were 22,758,797 active benefits in the Italian pension system (+0.2 percent compared to 2020) with a total annual amount of 313,003 million euros (+1.7 percent compared to 2020).
IT_156	4	"This is the finding of the observatory on ""Pension Benefits and Beneficiaries in the Italian Pension System"" published by Inps ."
IT_156	5	There are 16,098,748 recipients of pension benefits (up 3.6 percent from 2020), with an average of 1.4 pensions per person, also of different types: 68 percent receive only one benefit, while 32 percent receive two or more; in particular, 24 percent of recipients receive two benefits, 75 percent three, and 1 percent four or more.
IT_156	6	Women account for the majority share of the total number of pensioners (52 percent), but men receive 56 percent of pension income: in fact, the average amount of income received by women is 27 percent lower than that of men (16,501 versus 22,598 euros).
IT_156	7	Seventy-eight percent of pensions are of the IVS type (disability, old age, survivors), while welfare benefits (civil disabilities, social allowances and pensions, war pensions) make up 19 percent of the total; the remaining about 3 percent are indemnity-type benefits, consisting of Inail annuities.
IT_156	8	The largest group of pensioners are old-age pensioners : there are 11,263,961 of them, of which 3,131,469 (28 percent) are also holders of other types of pensions.
IT_156	9	There are about one million Social Security disability pensioners, 49 percent of whom accumulate pensions of different types.
IT_156	10	There are 4,276,943 survivor pensioners; about one-third (33 percent) receive only survivor pensions, while the remaining 67 percent also receive other pensions.
IT_156	11	There are about 3.7 million welfare benefit recipients; 50 percent also hold non-welfare benefits.
IT_156	12	They are mainly recipients of accompanying allowances who also receive pensions of the welfare type.
IT_156	13	Finally, there are 650,799 holders of indemnity-type annuities, of which the vast majority (72 percent) combine this benefit with other types of social security and/or welfare benefits.
IT_156	14	Analyzing the distribution of retirees by age group, five-year breadth between 65 and 79 years old, it is observed that the largest class, for both males and females , is the over-80s.
IT_156	15	The class where the highest average amount is found is, for both sexes, between the ages of 65 and 69.
IT_156	16	An analysis of the spatial distribution of pensions and pensioners shows that both pensions and pensioners are more concentrated in northern regions, with 47 percent for both.
IT_156	17	Average pension amounts are higher in the North than in the rest of Italy (+7.2 percentage points above the national average).
IT_156	18	Also in terms of per capita income, the North has the highest average (+4.8 percent compared to the national average), followed by the Center (+4.3 percent), while the South has values below the national average.
IT_158	1	Stellantis towed by the electric:
IT_158	2	"Double-digit margin across the ""regions"" including the East"
IT_158	3	Stellantis' half-yearly report confirms the group's excellent period, just in its second year of existence, and, most importantly, demonstrates the state of grace of the automotive sector that has entered full throttle into the new mobility through the energy transition.
IT_158	4	The Italian-French-American giant achieved flattering targets with an operating income of 12.4 billion euros, up 44 percent over the first half of the year from 2021, close to that of the larger Volkswagen Group, which stood at 13 billion.
IT_158	5	Record-breaking margin.
IT_158	6	Net revenues in turn reached 88 billion, up 17 percent from June last year.
IT_158	7	Satisfied CEO Carlos Tavares: our plan is moving forward.
IT_158	8	"The overall margin reached 14.1 percent, with double-digit results in all five ""Regions"" into which the group divides its business."
IT_158	9	Also good was net income, which touched 8 billion.
IT_158	10	In Europe, as sales (-300 thousand cars) and, to some extent, revenues (-700 million) declined, the margin landed in double digits, rising from 8.8 percent in the first half of 2021 to 10.4 percent this year.
IT_158	11	In addition to shifting the center of gravity of the range upward with the sale of more expensive electric vehicles, there is a sharp reduction in discounts due to product shortages that unbalance the supply-demand ratio.
IT_158	12	The real surprise, however, is the performance of the North American market, which not only rivals Europe but is capable of accounting for nearly half of Stellatis' revenues (42.5 billion, up 10 billion from the six months of last year out of the total of 88 billion).
IT_158	13	Even more unbalanced are profits (over 7.5 billion compared to 5.2 billion) and margins (18.1 percent), which come close to the levels, not of premium brands, but luxury brands.
IT_158	14	"The margin is also doing very well in the Middle East and Africa (15.5 percent), South America (13.9 percent, but the third ""Region"" in sales) and China, India and Asia-Pacific (13.4 percent) where the end of the joint venture with GAC was recently announced."
IT_158	15	Maserati, more or less stable in sales and revenues, also doubled its margin, which, however, remains in single digits (from 3.3 percent to 6.6 percent).
IT_158	16	Annual targets of double-digit margin confirmed.
IT_158	17	Stellantis in the semester, in addition to presenting its long-term strategic plan (Dare Forward 2030), consolidated its expansion in electric vehicle batteries (5 Gigafactories, 3 in Europe and 2 in North America) with agreements with Samsung and LG.
IT_158	18	In Europe Stellantis ranks second in green vehicle sales (BEVs plus LEVs), in the U.S. it ranks third.
IT_158	19	In the six-month period, sales of electric vehicles increased by 50 percent to 136,000 units; 20 models are already on sale now, 28 more will arrive by 2024.
IT_158	20	In the U.S., a Jeep is the best-selling plug-in hybrid model; it is the stainless Wrangler, which, with 19,000 units sold from January to June, grew 55 percent.
IT_158	21	"Also being launched is the fifth generation of the flagship Grand Cherokee that is also rechargeable, meaning it can travel for some stretches at ""zero pollution."""
IT_158	22	Stellantis has also become a global leader in rental: with the acquisition of Share Now, the Free2move division that handles this business has reached 6 million customers worldwide.
IT_161	1	M5s punishes those who are restoring Taranto
IT_161	2	Arcelormittal CFO Aditya Mittal's conference-call with analysts recorded an important affirmation:
IT_161	3	"""We do not know exactly when the measure will be law but we have been given an indication that it will be before September 6."""
IT_161	4	He was referring to the reinstatement of the legal moratorium in place and expiring on this very date.
IT_161	5	Let us briefly reconstruct what this is all about.
IT_161	6	The Ilva plants in Taranto (18,000 direct and indirect workers), after commissarial management, were awarded by comparison of bids to Arcelormittal, the world's largest steel operator, which is French-Indian-owned.One of the critical elements of these plants, highlighted by several health surveys (whose reliability, however, is questionable), concerns the environmental impact of production activities.
IT_161	7	An internal impact, which relates to the conditions under which the work is carried out, and an external impact, which relates to the release of pollutants into the atmosphere and, in any case, the surrounding areas.
IT_161	8	This means that it is the responsibility of Arcelormittal to carry out Ilva's environmental work, according to a timetable with a deadline of August 2023.
IT_161	9	The timing gives an idea of the complexity of the operation that must be carried out in productive fullness.
IT_161	10	Blast furnaces, the heart of a steel plant, cannot be shut down without irreversible consequences (of which the judicial authority, due to obligations arising from the nature of prosecution, cannot take into account).
IT_161	11	Therefore, the factory must go on in its present condition while the ownership of it proceeds with the collateral and vital activities to reduce pollution within the limits set by law.
IT_161	12	So there is a serious problem to be addressed: if the plants go, they will pollute, at least until, in August 2023, Ilva's environmental accommodation is finished.
IT_161	13	If there is pollution, there are criminal consequences.
IT_161	14	For this specific reason, the Renzi government had introduced a criminal moratorium rule for Arcelormittal directors for the period when production and cleanup must coexist.
IT_161	15	This coexistence is a mandatory and indispensable condition for the company that is investing in Ilva and its future.
IT_161	16	"It has been repeatedly stated, in fact, that in the absence of a regulation allowing production with consequent pollution (which must return to normal, I repeat, in August 2023), the interest of Arcelormittal (which should offer its managers as the designated victims of a paradoxical ""Italian system"") in the continuation of Ilva's management would be lost."
IT_161	17	It is not about something right or wrong.
IT_161	18	This is something necessary, from an economic point of view.Simple concepts, which should not face any obstacles.
IT_161	19	Instead, Luigi Di Maio allowed a 5Stelle amendment to abolish the moratorium when passing the Growth Decree (a challenging and misnomer).
IT_161	20	"In the face of the company's legitimate and supportable reaction (for this government, ""pacta non sunt servanda""), Di Maio, exemplary in duplicity, confirmed the lifting of the moratorium but opened a negotiating table."
IT_161	21	"Now, after the words of Cfo Aditya Mittal, the Ministry of Economic Development has ""categorically"" denied it (this categorically is a lexical monument to bureaucratic stupidity), adding ""never again shield for work deaths and environmental disasters."""
IT_161	22	It is impossible to believe the words of the ministry and (for li branches) Di Maio.
IT_161	23	It seems, in fact, out of touch to conjure up a shield for work-related deaths and environmental disasters.
IT_161	24	The recent workplace accidents that claimed two lives happened inside a plant that needs to be modernized in terms of work safety and pollutant releases.
IT_161	25	To speak of environmental disasters in such a case denounces the bad faith of those who make such claims.
IT_161	26	"He is much more reliable Matthieu Jehl, Ceo of Arcelormittal, who said and repeats, ""We are asking for compliance with agreed-upon standards, that is, the necessary legal protection to be able to continue implementing the environmental plan."
IT_161	27	"We remain hopeful that a solution will be found."""
IT_161	28	Sooner or later, in any case before September 6, 2019, will come el dia de la verdad in which the lies will irretrievably come to light.
IT_161	29	It is rumored in the circles that Arcelormittal has the recordings of what has been said in the meetings it has had since the issue of legal protection was opened.
IT_161	30	And on that day, in the dia de la verdad we will read its contents.
IT_161	31	The stakes, moreover, remain intact: the continuation or otherwise of Ilva's industrial life and the working lives of 18,000 men and women in Taranto.
IT_165	1	Fuels, Mild: Gasoline at 1.85 euros/liter, diesel at 1.722 euros/liter.
IT_165	2	Consumer reaction
IT_165	3	According to weekly data from the Ministry of Ecological Transition , gasoline , in self-service mode, reaches 1.850 euros per liter, diesel 1.722 euros per liter.
IT_165	4	"""The run-up in fuel prices is now unstoppable."

IT_165	6	"""In exactly one year, since the survey of Feb. 22, 2021, when gasoline was 1,519 euros per liter and diesel fuel was 1,391 euros per liter, a 50-liter fill-up costs 16 euros and 57 cents for both gasoline and diesel fuel, a 21.8 percent and 23.8 percent increase, respectively."
IT_165	7	"A sting, on an annual basis, of 398 euros for both gasoline and diesel,"" Dona added."
IT_165	8	"""The government is asleep and does not understand that fuels , like electricity and gas, are also driving up inflation, affecting the transportation costs of all goods."
IT_165	9	"That is why it is urgent that excise taxes be reduced by at least 20 cents, cooling prices and returning them to reasonable levels,"" he concluded."
IT_165	10	"""Just for the higher costs associated with fuel supplies, a family finds itself today spending about 400 euros a year more than in 2021,"" attacked Codacons President Carlo Rienzi. ""The state with VAT and excise taxes continues to make money through higher prices at the pump, while families suffer progressive impoverishment."
IT_165	11	"The government can no longer stand idly by, and urgent action is needed because the run-up in gasoline and diesel prices is having a heavy effect on retail prices, hurting the entire Italian economy."""
IT_165	12	"""An emergency that impoverishes consumers but enriches the coffers of the state, which, thanks to the increases in fuel prices, collects more revenue from the taxes on gasoline and diesel,"" stressed Assoutenti President Furio Truzzi. ""This is why we are asking Premier Draghi to convene consumer associations as soon as possible in order to study measures to combat high gasoline prices, starting with the indispensable sterilization of VAT and a reduction in the weight of excise taxes, a measure that now seems no longer postponable."
IT_171	1	Trawell's sprint
IT_171	2	A new contract with Prague Airport, the largest in Eastern Europe, sent Trawell soaring on Egm, with the stock jumping 5.84 percent to 6.52 euros.
IT_171	3	Trawell operates globally in protection services, baggage storage, products and ancillary services, and its subsidiary Bag Czech Republic has won the tender to provide integrated traveler assistance services at Prague International Airport for a seven-year period starting in June.
IT_171	4	In 2019, the last pre-pandemic, Prague Airport handled traffic of 17.8 million passengers, all international.
IT_171	5	"Intesa Sanpaolo reaffirmed its add recommendation and €7.3 target price on Trawell after the contract in the Czech Republic: ""The new concession is important and, assuming"" that the service is used by 2.5 percent of total passengers, ""in a preliminary simulation we estimate that it can generate more than €3 million when fully operational, more than 15 percent of 2021 revenues,"" the analysts comment."
IT_171	6	"Yesterday, analysts, following the Egm Conference 2022, had pointed to the fact that Trawell is participating in many tenders, pointing out that it ""may be close to winning the airport concession in Milan."
IT_171	7	"The company does not rule out partnerships with other operators to accelerate its growth and is expected to present its business plan in the coming months."""
IT_171	8	( )
IT_171	9	New concessions, store improvements, digital services, and a renewed commitment to the full expression of group value.
IT_171	10	These are the four cornerstones of the 2022-2027 business plan approved by the board of directors of TraWell Co. an Italian airport services company.
IT_171	11	The four pillars of the 2022-2027 business plan As early as this year, TraWell's operations picked up after a period of slowdown caused by the pandemic.
IT_171	12	"Now the company is aiming to renovate and acquire new commercial space at more profitable airports , ""exploiting weaknesses manifested by competitors,"" according to a note."
IT_171	13	According to group estimates, the new concessions could bring an increase in sales from an expected 21 million in 2022 to 31.2 million in 2027.
IT_171	14	Another challenging target concerns ebitda, expected from 4.1 million for the current year to 7 million by the end of the plan.
IT_171	15	A long journey that will involve store improvements with the aim of increasing profits in each area, diversifying products and building customer loyalty.
IT_171	16	Digitization is then the third pillar of the business plan.

IT_176	1	New record for Italian government debt, more BTPs in foreign portfolios
IT_176	2	New record for Italian public debt.
IT_176	3	In fact, in July, general government debt increased by 23.5 billion from the previous month to 2,409.9 billion.
IT_176	4	"Bank of Italy, in its statistical publication ""Public Finance, Demand and Debt,"" explained that the increase was due to a 27.1 billion increase in Treasury cash holdings to 94.8 billion (they were 80 billion as of July 2018), which more than offset the general government cash surplus (3.4 billion)."
IT_176	5	While haircuts and premiums on issuance and redemption, revaluation of inflation-indexed securities and changes in exchange rates together reduced debt by 0.2 billion.
IT_176	6	With reference to the breakdown by subsectors, central government debt increased by 23.7 billion, conversely, local government debt decreased by 0.1 billion.
IT_176	7	In contrast, the debt of pension plans has remained virtually unchanged.
IT_176	8	As for tax revenues recorded in the state budget in July amounted to 46.5 billion, down 5.9 percent (2.9 billion) from the same month in 2018.
IT_176	9	The drop was affected by the extension to Sept. 30 of the self-assessment payment deadlines for taxpayers subject to the Synthetic Indexes of Tax Reliability.
IT_176	10	In the first seven months of the year, tax revenues amounted to 235.8 billion, down 0.3 percent (0.7 billion) from the same period last year; net of the effects of the above-mentioned extension and some accounting mismatches, it can be estimated that the dynamics of tax revenues were more favorable, Bank of Italy pointed out.
IT_176	11	Finally, in June, the equivalent value of the portfolio of Italian government bonds held by foreign entities rose to 679.176 billion euros, the highest level since May 2018, from 646.531 billion last May.
IT_176	12	Based on Reuters calculations of Via Nazionale data, the share of securities in the hands of nonresidents in June of the total outstanding was up to 33.5 percent from 32.2 percent in May.
IT_176	13	Today's data include government securities held by domestic investors through nonresident entities (such as asset managers and funds) and those held directly by the Eurosystem (not through the Bank of Italy) and by central banks of other countries.
IT_176	14	On Friday, the newly appointed Minister of Economy, Roberto Gualtieri, said he was in favor of decoupling from the structural deficit spending on investments in the environmental and social economy and spoke of a three-year plan to reduce taxes, excluding patrimonial assets; he then reiterated Italy's commitment to a reduction in public debt and called for a more expansive fiscal policy for the euro zone.
IT_176	15	"A restrictive budget law would be ""counterproductive"" according to Gualtieri, who also called the previous government's privatization targets for this year (18 billion euros) ""unrealistic."""
IT_176	16	The target of the new privatization plan would be 5-6 billion, with the possible sale to Cdp of shares in and .
IT_176	17	And the deficit target for 2020 of the titular officeholder in Via XX Settembre would be very close to 2 percent, according to a background published by Corriere della Sera.
IT_182	1	Area 24, there is an understanding to liquidate it and save the future of the bike lane
IT_182	2	Decisive turning point for the liquidation of debt-ridden Area 24 and the salvation--betting on new management and an adequate relaunch, including promotional--of the bike path between Ospedaletti and San Lorenzo al Mare, built precisely by the joint venture formed by the City of Sanremo and the Region (through its financial Filse) with 43 percent of shares each, plus Carige, with 14 percent, in the dual role of partner and lender.
IT_182	3	Yesterday in a notary's office in Genoa, in fact, the agreement was signed between all the parties involved, against the debt restructuring and reorganization plan prepared by Area 24's liquidators-namely, San Remo lawyer Ilaria Lanteri and Massa accountant Luca Mannini-and immediately transmitted electronically to the court in Imperia, which will have to set the hearing for approval, that is, final approval: presumably between April and May.
IT_182	4	Under the agreement, which had been worked on for more than a year, the section of the bike path between Arma di Taggia and San Lorenzo al Mare will be purchased by the San Remo public company Amaie Energia , which already handles separate waste collection in the district and other municipalities in the Imperia area, for 1.6 million euros; Ospedaletti will buy its portion of the bike path (for 600,000 euros), while San Remo already owns the section in its territory.
IT_182	5	To Carige, as part of the larger deal whereby it sold its non-performing loans to Amco, a company owned by the Ministry of Economy, will go the proceeds from the sale of the former stations (San Lorenzo al Mare, Santo Stefano al Mare) and other properties, such as parking lots in the facility, already mortgaged by the bank.
IT_182	6	It will be the commissioners of Area 24 themselves, through a public bidding process, who will look for buyers, otherwise Amco will take over; the same thing will be done by the municipality of Ospedaletti for the sale of properties in its territory, free of mortgages.
IT_182	7	Still, an attempt will be made to place on the market the operation to complete the parking garage and commercial spaces of the Millenium bankruptcy in Arma di Taggia, an issue headed by the related company Park 24.
IT_182	8	All of the economic resources thus acquired will be used to reimburse Carige for at least part of the more than 17 million euros (another 1.8 million is owed to the Banca di Caraglio) of credit it has: realistically, it may perhaps be able to cover half or a little more; and to pay the 110 work contractors and suppliers, for another total credit of 2.2 million.
IT_182	9	These creditors are divided into two groups: one half of them have agreed to a deal to be paid, in many cases with a reduction in the amount, beyond 120 days from the court's approval; the others will be repaid by that deadline, to the extent of 100 percent.
IT_182	10	"Comments Andrea Gorlero, president of Amaie Energia: ""We welcome this decisive step, which makes it possible to support the many local businesses that are creditors of Area 24, and thus the provincial economy."
IT_182	11	"And that finally allows us to look, by the summer of 2020, at the acquisition and management of such a strategic infrastructure as the bike path."""
IT_183	1	Duties, the signing of the agreement between the US and China.
IT_183	2	Trump:
IT_183	3	"""Historic, I will visit in the not-too-distant future."""
IT_183	4	"""We take a step never before taken with China,"" a ""step toward fair trade"" that ""rewrites the mistakes of the past"" and ensures ""a future of justice for American farmers, workers and families."""
IT_183	5	"U.S. President Donald Trump thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping (""a great friend of mine, who is following us"") in the speech at the White House introducing the signing on the Phase 1 agreement between the two economic superpowers on trade issues."
IT_183	6	"The U.S. president-in a three-quarter-hour speech-called it a ""historic"" step and assured that he will visit the Asian superpower in the ""not-too-distant future."""
IT_183	7	It was, after a long silent listening to the American speeches, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He who read a letter from President Xi addressed to the American leader.
IT_183	8	"""The trade agreement demonstrates that China and the U.S. can iron out differences and find solutions to problems based on dialogue,"" one of the passages in the missive in which it hopes the states will treat Asian companies fairly and support cooperation at all levels between the two sides."
IT_183	9	The ceremony at the White House enshrined the understanding, which includes transfers of technology, intellectual property, food and agricultural products, financial services and trade expansion.
IT_183	10	China will significantly increase imports of agricultural products from the U.S., such as pork, poultry, soybeans, wheat, corn and rice, one of the points Trump cared most about.
IT_183	11	The president remarked that Chinese investments (in the range of 50 billion each) will also cover the energy sector and financial services, as well as there will be cooperation on competitive currency devaluations and tight stakes on the issue.
IT_183	12	The U.S. for its part will revoke the risk of new 15 percent tariffs that were to be triggered last Dec. 15 on nearly $160 billion of made-in-China products, to which Beijing reportedly responded with tariffs on 3,300 U.S. products.
IT_183	13	But it was not a euphoric eve, after positive days in the markets despite tensions with Iran.
IT_183	14	In the hours leading up to the White House conference, it emerged that Washington will not eliminate duties at 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports, while tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese products will be reduced to 7.5 percent (from the current 15 percent).
IT_183	15	Taking them off will likely have to wait until the vote next November.
IT_183	16	On the contrary, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took advantage of an interview with Cnbc to make it clear that the United States is ready to increase tariffs on Chinese products if the other side fails to meet its commitments.
IT_183	17	Again Trump explained that the duties will be removed as Phase 2 of the agreement is finalized, for which discussions will begin soon-the U.S. wanted to hold on to cards to play on the second table.
IT_183	18	"""We do not expect a phase 3 agreement to be necessary,"" he said."
IT_183	19	This and other thoughts have tilted markets toward a cautious approach, especially in Europe, while Wall Street has been able to update its records.
IT_183	20	"For example, Intesa Sanpaolo remarked in its morning report that the agreement ""beyond the temporary stabilization of uncertainty, it should not be overstated."
IT_183	21	"In fact, the most contentious issues in the negotiations were left out and will be discussed in Phase 2, potentially affecting uncertainty in 2021."""
IT_183	22	"In addition, ""even the Phase 1 agreement maintains mechanisms for U.S. monitoring of China's fulfillment of its commitments (with possible duty increases in case of non-compliance) at the periodic updates, at least semi-annually, that will be part of the understanding."""
IT_183	23	Bloomberg highlighted how the very structure of the understanding is atypical for U.S. trade treaties, in that it is permeated with a 'socialist dirigisme' that goes so far as to spell out how Beijing will use the money put on the table to buy U.S. products, instead of setting the regulatory framework and then allowing the market freedom of action.
IT_183	24	Above all, one wonders if beyond mutual impositions and ultimatums, economic and technological ties between the two warring superpowers can ever be a little more relaxed and cooperative.
IT_185	1	Boehringer Ingelheim Italy:
IT_185	2	not just Top, but Global Employer
IT_185	3	Boehringer Ingelheim Italy is Top Employer Europe 2021.
IT_185	4	"A total of 112 companies have earned certification for 2021: the best companies to work in in Italy for attention in ""HR."""
IT_185	5	"Also this year, the Top Employers Institute, for the first time, honored Boehringer Ingelheim as a ""Global Top Employer,"" one of the world's top 16 employers."
IT_185	6	An award that demonstrates how Boehringer Ingelheim Italy, for the third year in a row, confirms its strong focus on research and development of innovative therapeutic solutions, also making use of new avenues, such as the recent cooperation with Google on quantum computing, is equally oriented to the needs and well-being of its employees, both globally and locally.
IT_185	7	Top Employers Institute, a global certifier of corporate excellence in HR, also recognized Boehringer Ingelheim's long-term strategic orientation and inclusive corporate culture, which leads to close ties and loyalty between employees and the Company.
IT_185	8	"Commenting on the 2021 Certification, Antonio Barge, HR Director of Boehringer Ingelheim Italy said, ""Taking care of people's well-being, making our employees feel that they are central to the reality in which they work, is one of the core values of Boehringer Ingelheim's corporate culture."
IT_185	9	"For us, it is crucial that our people experience this centrality, and for this reason, we have always been strongly committed to promoting initiatives aimed at creating a work environment that fosters the professional growth and development of individuals."""
IT_185	10	It is a fact how, since March 2020, the world has changed and, at the same time, the labor scenario has itself undergone structural diversification.
IT_185	11	The pandemic has forced a change of perspective in work arrangements, especially in the face of the compulsory and massive adoption of smart working.
IT_185	12	Boehringer Ingelheim has been among the forerunners of the flexible work environment, a concept that spans multiple aspects, including well-being and balancing professional responsibilities with personal life.
IT_185	13	"""As Boehringer Ingelheim Italy, we have therefore been able to put, from the very beginning, all our people in a position to work safely, remotely,"" Antonio Barge points out."
IT_185	14	For us, smart working was already an established practice, introduced long ago in the company, and widespread at any level of job classification: in fact, for more than two years, our office-based employees had already been able to work from home, with no maximum limit of working days/year.
IT_185	15	A rewarding best practice that continues to pay off, based on the principles of mutual trust and responsibility between the individual worker and the Company and on working by objectives.
IT_185	16	Certainly in such a complex year, remote work has had a twofold effect: on the one hand, it has enabled social distancing, on the other hand, it has led to redesigning the way people work and conceive of their work, but also to the need to find the right balance between work and private sphere.
IT_185	17	"In order to be even closer to our people, the online psychological counseling service, run by an external company of specialists in the field, has also been enhanced, precisely to provide additional help to employees in dealing with the particular period we are experiencing."""
IT_185	18	For Boehringer Ingelheim, policies to foster employee well-being are an important opportunity to stimulate organizational improvement as well, with effects on business productivity and opportunities for growth in the socioeconomic environment in which the company operates.
IT_185	19	Therefore, at the Italian level, the Company has developed multiple welfare initiatives aimed at improving the lives of employees: from psychophysical well-being to parenting management and time-saving benefits.
IT_187	1	Stock exchange, Milan closes up 0.62 percent.
IT_187	2	Stellantis Rally
IT_187	3	Major European stock exchanges closed higher (+0.88% Frankfurt, +0.80% Paris, +0.71% Amsterdam, +0.60% London and +0.63% Milan at 22,728 points, with the Ftse Mib returning to two-month highs).
IT_187	4	Is the dollar still a safe haven currency?
IT_187	5	For Rabobank, the euro could weaken in the short term due to uncertainties in Europe related to energy supplies, potential recession and Italian politics.
IT_187	6	At the same time, the dollar is expected to remain strong due to currency-friendly interest rate differentials and demand for safe haven assets.
IT_187	7	"According to Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank.: ""We expect the 1.01 euro/dollar area to serve as solid support going forward, but the cross is likely to fall back below parity in a 1- to 3-month outlook."""
IT_187	8	"Still, some are beginning to doubt the greenback's role as a safe haven currency : according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov , the dollar ""has ceased to be a reliable reserve currency."""
IT_187	9	Last Friday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, agreed that Turkey would pay for Russian gas partially in rubles .
IT_187	10	"Russia has already suspended gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark, and as of July 30 also to Latvia ""due to violation of the conditions for gas withdrawal,"" namely paying in rubles."
IT_187	11	Thus the dollar loses ground against the Russian currency and is trading at 60.52 rubles.
IT_187	12	Greenback also weak in the cross with the euro trading up 0.38 percent at $1.02.
IT_187	13	Oil rises driven by Chinese export data.
IT_187	14	On the commodities front, crude oil continues to rise after the release of economic data from China : Brent rises 1.29 percent to $96.14 per barrel, while Wti gains 1.17 percent to $90.05.
IT_187	15	China's exports grew at a faster-than-expected pace last month, suggesting that Beijing is not yet feeling the slowdown in Western economies.
IT_187	16	Meanwhile, according to Capital Economics, Russia-related supply risks and limited supply increases by Opec+ will affect crude oil prices, which will continue to hover around $100 a barrel.
IT_187	17	Among other commodities, gold trades up 0.83 percent at $1,806 an ounce, while at the Ttf gas loses 2.46 percent to 191.5 euros per megawatt hour.
IT_189	1	Liz Truss torpedoes Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, pound suffers.
IT_189	2	Gilt yield drops to 4 percent
IT_189	3	The pound loses 0.73 percent against the dollar and slides to 1.1246 after confirmation that U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng has been torpedoed by British Prime Minister Liz Truss.
IT_189	4	This was anticipated by the British Times newspaper.
IT_189	5	Surprisingly, Kwarteng had returned early from Washington from the International Monetary Fund meeting.
IT_189	6	Liz Truss will hold a press conference at 3 p.m.
IT_189	7	And, according to the Times, he will also announce plans to raise corporate tax, thus reneging on the £45 billion mini-finance presented in late September focused on reducing taxes on the wealthiest segments of the population.
IT_189	8	Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange rises a brisk 1 percent and the yield on the 10-year Gilt falls to 4.04 percent.
IT_189	9	Analysts expect Liz Truss to retract several parts or most of the plan.
IT_189	10	A reversal that would be the crowning achievement of a hectic few weeks for British politics.
IT_189	11	In fact, since the plan was announced three weeks ago, the pound has hit an all-time low against the dollar, the Bank of England has intervened to stabilize the government bond market, and Conservative Party support has fallen to an all-time low in the latest polls.
IT_189	12	The Bank of England's announcement that it will end its temporary support program for the Gilts has pushed long-dated yields above 5.1 percent, after touching 3.6 percent in the aftermath of the maneuver announcement.
IT_189	13	Later, there was speculation that the BoE would backtrack on this position if market conditions warranted it, and this, coupled with rumors that the government would be forced to backtrack on parts of its fiscal plan, led to a decline in yields.
IT_189	14	"At the same time, data indicated that the British economy would contract during the third quarter, while the sharp drop in economic confidence after the ""mini budget"" implied that the country was already in recession."
IT_189	15	"""With markets predicting a sharp rise in interest rates in the UK, financial conditions have tightened, posing a substantial threat to the housing market."
IT_189	16	"According to our estimates, about 2 million households are expected to see their mortgage costs double within the next 12 months if the Bank of England raises rates, as predicted by futures prices,"" noted Mark Dowding, CIO of BlueBay."
IT_189	17	"If this were to happen, ""we would extrapolate a 40 percent decline in house prices, which would mirror the price trend in long-dated real estate fixed income this year."
IT_189	18	In turn, this could trigger the risk of financial and economic collapse.
IT_189	19	Consequently, we believe that the BoE cannot simply raise rates in this way and would do well to tighten them much more modestly.
IT_189	20	In many respects this seems justified, as inflation expectations are now lower than they were before the mini-budget, thanks to energy price trends and concerns about the economic outlook.
IT_189	21	We probably believe that the UK will be forced into an outcome where inflation can remain higher for longer.
IT_189	22	"This implies,"" Dowding predicted, ""a steeper British yield curve and a weaker pound."
IT_193	1	Vontobel:
IT_193	2	Healthy optimism needed, best returns are generated from falling markets
IT_193	3	A disciplined research process is essential in investment.
IT_193	4	But what gets you over the finish line is a healthy and enduring optimism .
IT_193	5	The belief that truly great companies will help generate lasting, compounded returns.
IT_193	6	Healthy optimism is difficult for even the most sophisticated investors to apply.
IT_193	7	In rising and euphoric markets as in recent years, optimism has been distorted and sadly misplaced.
IT_193	8	SPACs, cryptocurrencies and hyper-growth companies without profits have been all the rage.
IT_193	9	IN TIMES OF PANIC WE NEED OPTIMISM This year, markets have swung toward pessimism.
IT_193	10	Inflation is at 40-year highs and growth appears to be slowing .
IT_193	11	The World Bank claims that the global economy could suffer a 1970s-style stagflation.
IT_193	12	The still-ongoing pandemic, war, rising food prices, and persistent problems of weakening supply chains and consumers fuel distrust.
IT_193	13	But Matthew Benkendorf, CIO boutique Quality Growth at Vontobel, believes that in times of panic, investors need a dose of healthy optimism.
IT_193	14	DON'T BET ON SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS The best line of defense for an optimist, Vontobel's expert explains, is to find companies with attractive underlying economics and a sustainable and predictable earnings stream.
IT_193	15	"Then, attribute a realistic and conservative assessment, because as Thomas Edison stated, ""Opportunity is missed by many because it is dressed in work clothes and looks like work."""
IT_193	16	The panic of the day concerns the potential for prolonged late 1970s-style hyperinflation and its implications for stock markets.
IT_193	17	As bottom-up investors, Vontobel is not betting on a specific inflation forecast; it needs its holdings to perform well under a range of plausible macroeconomic scenarios.
IT_193	18	THE PRECEDENT OF THE LATE 1970s The late 1970s and early 1980s witnessed significant outperformance by quality growth stocks traded at reasonable valuations.
IT_193	19	HOLT/Credit Suisse examined the relative performance of different investment styles from that period.
IT_193	20	Quality growth stocks traded at reasonable valuations can perform better than the market during inflationary phases.
IT_193	21	An empirical result that makes intuitive sense in that more profitable companies with pricing power and lower leverage are better able to cope with cost pressures.
IT_193	22	Instead, securities traded at exorbitant multiples should be avoided.
IT_193	23	APPROACHED RESEARCH Vontobel's optimism and outlook will always be based on thorough business research, portfolio construction, and disciplined application of investment philosophy.
IT_193	24	Unprecedented stimulus and prolonged low rates unleashed a frenzy in private credit that helped create an illusion of wealth across the board.
IT_193	25	Asset prices eventually converge to a value that represents true intrinsic value, both upward and downward, which is one reason why Benkendorf is particularly optimistic about the prospects for quality growth.
IT_193	26	LONG-TERM PREMIUM The best investors are patient, looking beyond short-term weakness and keeping an eye on the long-term premium.
IT_193	27	We need to do our homework on valuation and predictability of long-term profits, separate facts from speculation, and the fruits will come.
IT_193	28	Tough markets are not to be feared , Vontobel's expert points out.
IT_193	29	No matter how uneasy one may feel and the outlook may seem dire, it will always be better to have an optimistic determination and a clear road map.
IT_193	30	BEST INVESTMENTS CONCEIVED IN DOWNWARD MARKETS The best investment returns , Benkendorf points out in conclusion, are conceived in down markets, only to be realized in the most favorable periods.
IT_194	1	Fed, markets await rate decision.
IT_194	2	But what will happen next?
IT_194	3	The markets' focus is on the next moves by the Federal Reserve, which will announce monetary policy decisions on the evening of July 27.
IT_194	4	Analysts agree that the interest rate hike is likely to be 75 basis points, following the already approved increase of 75 points in June, 50 in May and 25 in March.
IT_194	5	Abrdn money managers point out that the rather eccentric communication approach taken by the Fed at its last meeting, with leaks to The Wall Street Journal in the days leading up to it, made the market more nervous about the possibility of a last-minute surprise.
IT_194	6	"""However,"" for the experts, ""in light of market prices and recent data, we believe that 75 percentage points is likely."""
IT_194	7	"After rate hike the dollar could weaken a bit The dollar could see a downward reaction if the Federal Reserve decides on a 75 basis point interest rate hike, as expected, ""but any decline will not last,"" say Ing."
IT_194	8	"""The Fed is likely to signal further rate hikes, which should support the dollar in the coming weeks,"" say analysts, who believe that in the meantime unstable risk sentiment and gas supply problems in Europe could drive flows to safe haven assets such as the dollar."
IT_194	9	"""The Dollar Index Dxy could fall today to the 106.50 area after the Fomc announcement, but we still expect a return to 108 before the end of the week,"" they conclude."
IT_194	10	The U.S. will enter recession in 2023.
IT_194	11	The Federal Reserve's July meeting comes at a crucial time on the economic calendar, given the likelihood that GDP on Thursday will show a second consecutive quarter of contraction.
IT_194	12	"According to Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at Abrdn, ""it is clear that there has been a slowdown in activity recently,"" he explains, ""but it would be wrong to say that the recession began in the first quarter of this year."
IT_194	13	It doesn't.
IT_194	14	However, so far the Fed has told a reasonably optimistic story about activity and demand in the economy.
IT_194	15	"Some scaling back of the language used to describe the economy might be appropriate given the recent weakness."""
IT_194	16	Therefore, for the expert, the inflation-fighting path followed by the Fed will lead to a recession next year.
IT_194	17	A more moderate increase is possible in September.
IT_194	18	"After developments since the last meeting, says Gero Jung, chief economist at Mirabaud Am, ""it is clear that inflation has accelerated further and remains broad-based, while the labor market remains solid."""
IT_194	19	"However, the economist adds, ""inflation expectations, according to the University of Michigan survey, have fallen, signaling that a more aggressive move such as a 100 basis point rate hike is unlikely."""
IT_194	20	"The important element ""will be Chairman Powell's forward guidance, particularly regarding the next meeting, and whether a rate hike of 75 basis points or a more modest one of 50 can be expected."""
IT_194	21	"Although the next decision will depend on the data, ""we expect a more moderate 50-point rise in September,"" Mirabaud's expert concludes."
IT_205	1	China, inspectors in Wuhan:
IT_205	2	WHO investigation into the origin of Covid begins
IT_205	3	BEIJING - In the end, the visas were granted.
IT_205	4	The World Health Organization team of experts to investigate the origins of the coronavirus will arrive in China on Thursday, Beijing authorities announced yesterday.
IT_205	5	"Last week, WHO director Tedros Ghebreyesus had said he was ""very disappointed"" that China had not yet authorized entry, a rare expression of frustration from an official always soft on Beijing."
IT_205	6	"Now the situation has unblocked, Tedros wrote that WHO ""looks forward to working with Chinese counterparts."""
IT_205	7	But doubts about the Dragon's real willingness to cooperate, beyond words, are far from dispelled.
IT_205	8	The telegraphic communiqué in which the government announces the arrival of the scientists, one sentence, does not specify what their itinerary will be.
IT_205	9	"And yesterday afternoon a Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated the regime's official position, crystallized by a long disinformation campaign, that the Sars-Cov-2 investigation must ""involve several countries,"" because the origin is not necessarily in China."
IT_205	10	The issue is widely politicized.
IT_205	11	"The Trump administration has tried to turn the geographic designation ""Chinese virus"" into an attribution of blame; for all its response, China seeks to substantiate the unsubstantiated assumption that the virus originated abroad or at any rate in various places (including Italy)."
IT_205	12	In this climate, the investigation, already difficult for objective reasons, is likely to become prohibitively expensive.
IT_205	13	Beijing, which repeats that it wants to cooperate, has resisted in various ways.
IT_205	14	In July, it did not allow two Oms technicians on an exploratory mission to reach Wuhan after keeping them quarantined for two weeks.
IT_205	15	And he authorized the current mission only having gotten his experts to carry out the first surveys in the city, which were completed in late December.
IT_205	16	Meanwhile, the government keeps a close watch on all research on the origin of the pathogen, which cannot be published without permission.
IT_205	17	In theory, the experts arriving Thursday should also undergo 14 days of quarantine.
IT_205	18	Then they will leave for Wuhan, where they will be accompanied by Chinese colleagues.
IT_205	19	It is unclear how much freedom of investigation they will enjoy.
IT_205	20	After all, it has been a year since the outbreak emerged in the Hubei capital: on January 11, 2020, China announced the first death from Covid19 just two days earlier.
IT_205	21	In these hours, the Dragon is also facing its most serious viral outbreak in months, nearly 500 cases in Hebei province around Beijing.
IT_205	22	The capital Shijiazhuang has been put on lockdown, all 11 million inhabitants tested: this is the mode of warfare by which China has so far avoided second waves.
IT_205	23	But the alert level has been raised a lot as the mass migration of the New Year's holiday approaches.
IT_205	24	Authorities are trying to limit it: after recommending avoiding unnecessary travel, several provinces are introducing stricter requirements; they will only accept travelers with negative tampon.
IT_211	1	Democracy in emergency at the test of biopolitics
IT_211	2	Dictating our behavior is a scientific committee whose guidelines are certified and legitimized by the government.
IT_211	3	Suddenly, the gestures of our everyday life (blowing our noses, greeting with a handshake), our biological existence (old age) and our sociality (museums and bowling alleys, theaters and gyms) have become the subject of specific measures that take them out of their traditional private sphere and cast them into public space.
IT_211	4	The attempt to seize the naked lives of its subjects was at the heart of the project of twentieth-century totalitarianism, of Nazism in particular: in Hitler's delirium of power, the biological existence of individuals was to be fully included in the circuit of statehood, an occasion for the exercise of a power that was satiated by humiliating and defiling the bodies of its victims, reducing them to biologically animal beings.
IT_211	5	The lager was the place where this attempt showed itself in all its monstrosity.
IT_211	6	On the contrary, in the covenant of citizenship that underpins democratic and liberal constitutions, the object of state sovereignty has always been not the person as a mere living being with his bodily physicality, but only the person as a political actor.
IT_211	7	And it is precisely this virtuous root of democracy that is being tested today by the spread of the coronavirus.
IT_211	8	The path taken by the government is based on a very broad delegation to the scientific community, granting it a biopower that politics seems to have relinquished in what may appear to be a clear manifestation of subalternity.
IT_211	9	As well, precisely because we are in a democracy, science is itself far from monolithic and compact, and the interventions of scientists-torn by academic disputes and media rivalries-often add contradiction to contradiction, contributing to the general confusion.
IT_211	10	In reality today there is an acute need for politics, for a politics capable of regaining authority and credibility, abandoning the paths that saw it run aground on the shoals of the late twentieth century and from which we inherit an alienating paradox: to a state urged to abandon all the spaces it had won over the course of a century by intervening in the market, in production, in the overall organization of civil coexistence, to this same state that has been asked to take continuous steps backward by trying in every way to limit its invasiveness and scale back its interventions, we must necessarily rely on today to cope with the epidemic.
IT_211	11	And it is also on the basis of this paradox that explains the government's harried way of trying to juggle the opposing requirements to protect public health without harming production and the market.
IT_211	12	These fluctuations are the price politics pays to the opposing extremes of anti-politics on the one hand and the market on the other.
IT_211	13	A significant component of the yellow-red government, the one that comes from the 5 stars, is only able to repurpose a predictable mirroring with what is happening in the social world, oscillating between anxious furies and ironic sneers, between fake news hoaxes and prank videos; the other, embodied by the Pd, chases the fragments of the illusion of a market as a perfect world in itself, which just had to be left free to be itself, unimpeded.
IT_211	14	It is pe rce, however, time to rediscover the deeper meaning of politics.
IT_211	15	In recent years, starting with the 1992-1993 reforms and continuing through the 1999 reform, health care has been subjected to a stressful process of corporatization, fragmentation, and outsourcing that, through ever-increasing privatization, has led to the reduction of hospital beds by as many as 70,000.
IT_211	16	Unlike the coronavirus, the shortage of ICU places today therefore has nothing natural about it but is the result of choices that belong entirely to the cultural and social conjuncture we are experiencing; intervening in these choices calls into question a policy that precisely in the emergency can also find an opportunity for redemption.
IT_211	17	Paiòn traversìe eppurìe are opportunities, as Giambattista Vico used to say.
IT_213	1	AstraZeneca, is the mix with Pfizer and Moderna after the first dose safe?
IT_213	2	The study in Nature
IT_213	3	Those who took a first dose of AstraZeneca can today take a second dose of another brand of ?
IT_213	4	Does it work or does it hurt?
IT_213	5	A Spanish study, also cited in the influential scientific journal Nature , says the mix can trigger a powerful immune response against Sars-Cov-2.
IT_213	6	The research, carried out by the Carlos III Institute in Madrid , involved 663 people who had taken an initial dose of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, which uses a chimpanzee adenovirus to give human cells directions to produce a protein against Sars-Cov-2.
IT_213	7	Two-thirds of the participants were chosen to receive the Pfizer vaccine and that is mRna-based instead.
IT_213	8	"I get hundreds of emails in which many people, rightly concerned, ask me about the vaccination ""mix."""
IT_213	9	Is it acceptable that for the umpteenth time a decision is made regarding vaccines without explaining to citizens why, leaving this task to the talk shows?
IT_213	10	Roberto Burioni (@RobertoBurioni) June 12, 2021 According to Magdalena Campins, a researcher who participated in the work, the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine appears to shake the immune systems of those who had received Astrazeneca.
IT_213	11	After the second dose, participants began to have antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 levels higher than before.
IT_213	12	In contrast, people who had not received the booster had not had a change in antibodies.
IT_213	13	The immune system response explain from the Carlos III Institute-is significantly improved after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine while the observed adverse effects are mild to moderate and are mostly limited to the first 2-3 days after receiving the vaccine.
IT_213	14	No hospitalization secondary to the use of this vaccination regimen was reported in any case within this clinical trial.
IT_213	15	Nature explains how a British study analyzed combinations of the same two vaccines and found more common side effects, such as fever , than those who had two doses of the same vaccine.
IT_213	16	In the Spanish study, on the other hand, mild side effects were similar to those of standard vaccines, and none had severe effects.
IT_213	17	In this work, the most common were headache (44% of all cases), malaise (41%), chills (25%), mild nausea (11%), mild cough (7%) and fever (2.5%).
IT_218	1	Melanoma, early-stage immunotherapy also works in the real world
IT_218	2	Data collected in clinical practice do NOT always agree with what was seen during clinical trials.
IT_218	3	This time, however, it is.
IT_218	4	The case is the use of immunotherapy at an early stage in patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma, that is, at a stage when the disease has been completely excised.
IT_218	5	The study demonstrating this, which is being presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress, underway until Sept. 21, is Italian and is the world's largest program on the use of early-stage immunotherapy in the daily clinical practice of melanoma treatment.
IT_218	6	The results tell us that at two years, recurrence-free survival reached 58% and distant metastasis-free survival reached 70% of patients.
IT_218	7	"""The expanded access program was activated to allow patients to access nivolumab immunotherapy in adjuvant before the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) approval in this indication in December 2019,"" explains Paolo Ascierto, Director of the Melanoma Oncology, Oncology Immunotherapy and Innovative Therapies Unit at 'Pascale' in Naples."
IT_218	8	Patients out of clinical trials.
IT_218	9	The 611 patients, who had different characteristics than those in the registrational study because, for example, they were more frail, elderly, or had comorbidities, were in fact enrolled between November 2018 and June 2019.
IT_218	10	"""In patients with stage IIIB or IIIC disease who did not undergo adjuvant therapy after surgical resection, the 5-year recurrence rate is high at 71% and 85%."
IT_218	11	It should also be considered that half of the patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma come directly from stages I and II, the others from stage III after progression.
IT_218	12	"Adjuvant immunotherapy lasts only one year, increases the chance of avoiding disease recurrence and, therefore, potentially curing the person,"" the oncologist emphasizes."
IT_218	13	The sequence of therapies.
IT_218	14	Also presented for the first time at the ESMO Congress are preliminary results from the SECOMBIT study, which aims to identify the right sequence of therapies in people with metastatic melanoma who have the BRAF gene mutation.
IT_218	15	The trial experiments with three options to find the best sequence.
IT_218	16	The first is the combination of target therapies to continue with the combination of two immuno-oncology molecules, nivolumab and ipilimumab, after disease progression.
IT_218	17	The second option is dual immunotherapy to continue with combination target therapy after progression.
IT_218	18	Finally, the so-called 'sandwitch arm,' that is, the sequence of target therapies and the combination of the two immunotherapies and, only in case of progression, the continuation with target therapies.
IT_218	19	Data are available at a median follow-up of 32.2 months.
IT_218	20	"""The second option, starting with the combination of immunotherapies, achieves the best 3-year overall survival of 62%, compared with starting with the target therapy (54%) or the third option (60%)."
IT_218	21	"Preliminary data indicate a three-year progression-free survival of 53 percent starting with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab compared with 41 percent with molecular-targeted therapy and 54 percent with the third option,"" Ascierto says."
IT_218	22	"""The choice of immunotherapy before target therapy is therefore supported by these data and by the objective response rate, which halves from 45% to 25% when administered second-line."""
IT_218	23	New data on LAG-3.
IT_218	24	Also presented at ESMO is the update of the RELATIVITY-047 study on the combination of relatlimab and nivolumab in the first-line setting, with subgroup analysis.
IT_218	25	"""Relatlimab is a novel immuno-oncology molecule inhibitor of the immune checkpoint LAG-3,"" concluded Prof."
IT_218	26	Ascierto -.
IT_218	27	The results already presented last June at the American Congress of Medical Oncology are confirmed: median progression-free survival reached 10.12 months with the combination compared with 4.63 months with nivolumab monotherapy.
IT_218	28	"And the figure already shown with nivolumab plus ipilimumab is also confirmed, namely that for the treatment-free interval, which is significantly higher with the combination (3.22 months) than with monotherapy (1.41 months)."""
IT_218	29	'Pascale' has played a central role in the development of relatlimab, initiating the world's first study of the molecule in 2017 involving about 200 patients, demonstrating that LAG-3 plays a decisive role in resistance to anti-PD1 drugs such as nivolumab, thus representing an additional immune checkpoint used by cancer to circumvent response to immuno-oncology therapies.
IT_224	1	School Rome, profs and students on lockdown: tests are skipped in high schools
IT_224	2	At home because they tested positive for Covid or in isolation, they forced two out of three schools to revise their mid-year testing plan.
IT_224	3	Class assignments and quizzes in essence that serve to assess a student's progress in the first few months of the year and have teachers say between the end of January and the first half of February that boy or girl has gaps in Greek or Physics that they need to make up by June, so as not to risk being deferred or flunking out.
IT_224	4	But the virus, it was seen with the resumption of classes after the Christmas vacations spiked the curve of contagions and, playfully, the tests themselves were canceled, reduced, compressed.
IT_224	5	Cases.
IT_224	6	"""In our school,"" explains Maria Grazia Lancellotti, principal of Horace High School, ""we have opted for a mixed written and oral assessment, as long as there is one because in the current state you cannot expect three written assignments."
IT_224	7	By way of example for Latin or Greek as a matter of practice in the first part of the year, at least three versions would be needed to be translated into as many class assignments and at least two questions but the contagions, isolations, and quarantines have blown up the system.
IT_224	8	"Even for now, the criterion of strictness is not adopted,"" Lancellotti concludes, ""there is a great deal of flexibility that reflects the current condition: some classes have not been touched others have, and with quarantines organizing class assignments is complicated."
IT_224	9	"At Mamiani High School at the beginning of the school year, it was decided to reduce the number of tests: from three class assignments to two, with a single grade,"" explains Principal Tiziana Sallusti, ""between written and oral, and this choice was made precisely because we were aware that it would be a complex year."
IT_224	10	If a professor is absent because he or she is positive, you cannot replace him or her, or at least you cannot, because it is an absence of only a few days but this undeniably leads to curbing teaching and canceling tests.
IT_224	11	"At Righi, also in September, the decision was made to close with the testing plan before Christmas, adopting the trimester instead of the four-month period, but it is clear that class assignments and questions,"" explained Principal Cinzia Giacomobono, ""have been reduced."
IT_224	12	Delays on teaching.
IT_224	13	Class assignments, questions that are actually skipped or cannot suffice to properly assess, as was the case before Covid, students' preparation.
IT_224	14	With worse reverberations on technical and vocational secondary schools.
IT_224	15	Here alongside the habit checks there are also the practical ones.
IT_224	16	Lab activities that weigh on the curriculum and must be evaluated in both mechanics and hospitality colleges.
IT_224	17	Added to this is a delay on teaching that started as early as last year, again due to positives and quarantines, on which the very students are lashing out upon learning that the upcoming Maturity exam brings back written tests.
IT_224	18	"Net of the issue of end-of-quarter verifications,"" comments Michele Sicca, head of the Medi Student Network, ""the crucial issue is: what is being verified?"
IT_224	19	Since last year we have been paying for a delay on teaching that we would not like to go unnoticed in the face of the new Maturity Examination.
IT_224	20	The very students are now set to take to the streets again on Friday.
IT_224	21	And meanwhile, new infections are dropping dramatically: 6,615 positives were counted in Lazio yesterday, almost 5,000 fewer than the previous day.
IT_224	22	A very good sign showing that the curve is downhill.
IT_224	23	Admissions are also decreasing: between ordinary and intensive care, the balance is 2,351 patients.
IT_228	1	U.S. policymakers aim to turn the fight against the coronavirus (Covid-19) into a political war against China
IT_228	2	Some U.S. politicians, including Rick Scott, are trying to turn an epidemic that nations should face together into a political war against China.
IT_228	3	Senator Rick Scott, once CEO of the Columbia/HCA hospital network, might think he has something to say about public health issues.
IT_228	4	"He insisted that China's information on the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) cannot be trusted and asked the World Health Organization (WHO) to publish a ""full report,"" in a tweet he wrote, tagging the Global Times."
IT_228	5	By writing a letter to WHO and pushing WHO to do something it has already done, Scott's action is nothing more than whining for attention and support.
IT_228	6	"The instrumentalization of COVID-19, addressed by all humanity, as an opportunity to lash out at China's political system has become a bipartisan ""stereotype."""
IT_228	7	Aside from some who try to rub salt in the wounds like Scott, other politicians, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are busy propagating anti-China and anti-Huawei sentiment while the Chinese are fighting the epidemic.
IT_228	8	In recent years, amid the new wave of protectionism and unilateralism in the United States, targeting China has become a political buy-in for politicians.
IT_228	9	One after another, as in a competition, politicians have staged various theories of the Chinese threat to gain political capital.
IT_228	10	"The result was that China and the United States, two countries had close engagement and cooperation, began to separate, with the ""effort"" of politicians like Rick Scott, who shook their tongues to sow discord between the two countries, especially in the area of public health."
IT_228	11	Jennifer Bouey, senior researcher at the RAND Corporation, mentioned during a U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the COVID-19 outbreak on Feb. 5 that health workers in China and the U.S. have cooperated in every single pandemic and epidemic in China, but in the past two years, this relationship has faltered due to U.S.-China relations.
IT_228	12	He believes that the current difficulty in containing the virus was the reduction of cooperation between China and the United States in the past two or three years.
IT_228	13	An epidemic is not an activity of a single country.
IT_228	14	It requires close cooperation among the international community.
IT_228	15	In this sense, no country should cut itself off from international public health cooperation or undermine WHO, an organization created to promote cooperation among nations in terms of public health.
IT_228	16	However, according to various reports, U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to cut half of U.S. funding for WHO.
IT_228	17	"Scott, who has shown his concern about WHO and the way the agency is fulfilling its duty in China, should offer some evidence that his ""WHO complex"" is not just another argument he is using to gain political support."
IT_228	18	If he really cares about WHO, he should support it, or at least publicly oppose Trump's WHO funding cuts.
IT_228	19	Otherwise, he is just another cowardly U.S. politician interested only in adding insult to China's injury with no intention of helping.
IT_239	1	Anguish and terror: that red thread leading from Brooklyn to Ukraine
IT_239	2	It is still all to be deciphered at the time we go to press about the New York City subway bombing, but the date of April 12, 2022, at the beginning of Holy Week for the Catholic world, gives us yet another picture of terror, uncertainty, global instability, in the midst of the conflict in Ukraine that still threatens to deflagrate into World War III.
IT_239	3	New York terror is a tragic pairing that catapults the collective memory to the attack on the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001, an operation by the 19 suicide bombers of the Islamic paramilitary organization Al Qaeda (over 3,000 killed and 6.400 wounded the tally) that prompted the United States with allied nations (including Italy) to wars in Afghanistan (20 years from 2001 to last year) and Iraq (the invasion and arrest of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and the transitional government until 2011, the year of withdrawal).
IT_239	4	Considering the bomber's target of choice yesterday, trains, we cannot fail to recall the sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway (13 dead and thousands intoxicated) on March 20, 1995, by the Aum Shinrikyo religious sect at the behest of founder Shoko Asahara, who, according to investigators, attempted to carry out a coup d'état with deviated apparatuses of the Japanese police and armed forces.
IT_239	5	The sect was dismantled and its leader and other members hanged.
IT_239	6	In the same year, bombings with explosives were also carried out in the subways of Baku (Azerbaijan) and Paris.
IT_239	7	Again, on March 11, 2004, an Al Qaeda cell detonated 10 bombs on four regional trains in as many Madrid train stations, killing 192 people and injuring more than 2,000.
IT_239	8	The cell was discovered and dismantled by the police: 7 bombers were sentenced to heavy sentences, some committed suicide before the court verdict.
IT_239	9	But back to the date the bomber chose to strike at a subway station in Brooklyn, April 12.
IT_239	10	Putting the time machine in motion, it is only a curiosity that on April 12, 1928, a bomb killed 20 people and injured several dozen at the Milan Fairgrounds during the official visit of King Victor Emmanuel III.
IT_239	11	The investigation ended in nothing.
IT_239	12	Instead, it is perhaps more interesting to find out that also on April 12, but in 1945, the U.S. president who went down in history for being the only man in the world to drop atomic bombs on unarmed citizens, Harry Truman (1884-1972), began his term.
IT_239	13	Indeed, it was he, a World War I veteran on the French front, who decided to drop the 16-kiloton Little Boy on Hiroshima on August 6 of that year (166,000 casualties) and the 25-kiloton Fat Man on Nagasaki three days later (80,000 dead).
IT_239	14	At the moment, neither the identity nor the purpose of yesterday's lone terrorist in the heart of New York City is known, but one can venture only a few thoughts at large, trying to speculate on a mosaic of elements that might fit together.
IT_239	15	Truman is the name of the U.S. aircraft carrier that is sailing between the Ionian and Adriatic Seas in recent weeks, serving NATO (the Atlantic Alliance) in the long-distance confrontation with Russia as part of the new Cold War sparked by the Kremlin-launched invasion of Ukraine.
IT_239	16	In both the United States and Europe, Western intelligence has identified Moscow's undercover agents, sleeper cells to be activated for espionage actions, but not only that.
IT_239	17	Coordinating these cells was either the Gru (the military intelligence service) or the Svr, the former KGB, which at the time of the first Cold War had Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Putin (son of Lenin and Stalin's cook) in charge of its station in Dresden (in then East Germany).
IT_239	18	With a death toll of 16 wounded, could the Brooklyn bombing count as an early warning to the White House to discourage support for the Ukrainian people?
IT_239	19	In a storyline by novelist Tom Clancy (1947 2013) this scenario would appear entirely plausible, even if it turns out that the bomber is an African American.
IT_239	20	Certainly, on our television screens the intermingled images of the new terror in New York and the war in Ukraine have sent the thermometer of collective fear and anguish shooting up.
IT_239	21	But is that all that the lone killer disguised as a Subway employee, with a gas mask on his face, was aiming for?
IT_247	1	Putin cuts oil to Europe and sells it to Asia.
IT_247	2	But China doesn't trust it (and buys it at bargain prices)
IT_247	3	Don't you want my oil anymore ?
IT_247	4	Great!
IT_247	5	I will sell it elsewhere.
IT_247	6	With a little imaginative effort one can visualize Russian President Vladimir Putin hanging up the phone in the face of the chairwoman of the EU Commission uttering these disdainful words.
IT_247	7	Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of 'oil exports from to Europe have dropped by 60 percent, but the growth of sales to Asian countries has meant that Russian crude oil exports are even up from last year.
IT_247	8	Putin is therefore winning and mocking us along with the ?
IT_247	9	Not exactly.
IT_247	10	Price growth and European blockades.
IT_247	11	Since the outbreak of the war, Russian exports of fossil fuels to Europe have plummeted, but rising prices meant that Putin could even claim a trade surplus with which to continue funding the conflict, an argument often used by pro-Russian Westerners to push governments to lift sanctions.
IT_247	12	What needs to be made clear, however, is that the czar's moves served to loosen the economic grip of the West only at first.
IT_247	13	By early next year, the 'European Union will almost completely cease importing Russian oil (with some exceptions, including Hungary, which will have an extra year), but not only that.
IT_247	14	With the 'eighth package of sanctions approved last Oct. 6 It will be prohibited, it says on the EU Commission website, to provide maritime transportation and technical assistance, brokering services, financing or financial assistance related to the maritime transportation to third countries of crude oil (from December 2022) or petroleum products (from February 2023) originating in Russia or exported from Russia if such products will be purchased at a price above the price cap to be established in the European Union.
IT_247	15	This will drastically reduce Russian revenues or make it much more difficult to sell to countries like 'India : in fact, without European carriers, Russian oil would take ten times longer to reach Indian refineries.
IT_247	16	Russia is threatening not to sell to price cap participants, but this move by Europe means that non-European buyers such as Turkey , China and India have much more bargaining power.
IT_247	17	At the same time, falling gas prices and the possible imposition of a European price cap in this area as well will cut off another source of revenue for Moscow.
IT_247	18	Most Russian gas pipelines are bound for Europe, and the Kremlin, also aided by sanctions, does not have the technologies to liquefy the gas and store it while waiting to find another buyer and is therefore forced to burn it.
IT_247	19	China's role: friends but to what extent?
IT_247	20	Throwing the lifeline to his friend Putin was Chinese President Xi Jinping .
IT_247	21	An analysis in the New York Times points out that while China's import of fossil fuels overall has declined since January, partly due to production stoppages caused by Beijing's zero covid policy, purchases of gas and oil from Russia have increased.
IT_247	22	Good for Putin?
IT_247	23	The answer is: for now.
IT_247	24	China is buying Russian fuels at discounted prices, and if Moscow were forced to squeeze ever tighter into the Asian giant's embrace Xi Jinping would have more and more leverage to demand favorable prices.
IT_247	25	"But that's not all: work on the ""Strength of Siberia 2"" pipeline will not begin until 2024, and China may not want to push its purchases beyond a certain threshold."
IT_247	26	Recently, gas flows coming from Russia via pipelines already in operation have been disrupted for maintenance.
IT_247	27	Beijing has accepted the need for reparations, but the episode still does not speak in favor of Russia as a reliable energy partner.
IT_247	28	Moreover, China has always tried to diversify its sources of supply as much as possible precisely to prevent a supplier crisis from having catastrophic repercussions.
IT_247	29	China should avoid a situation where Russia becomes its main supplier of fossil fuels, Kevin Tu , Beijing's energy adviser, told the New York Times.
IT_247	30	If there are changes in international relations, there could be a big impact on China's energy security.
IT_247	31	In the face of a war in which Putin is increasingly in trouble, even boundless friendship must come to terms with the economic needs of a China that is not yet ready to cut ties with the West.
IT_M_007	1	Italy protagonist in Europe and the world
IT_M_007	2	Cradle of Western civilization, economic and cultural powerhouse, founding state of the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance:
IT_M_007	3	after too many years of marginality under leftist governments, Italy must return to prominence in Europe, the Mediterranean and the international chessboard.
IT_M_007	4	For a foreign policy focused on protecting the national interest and defending the homeland.
IT_M_007	5	Full compliance with our international alliances, including adjusting Defense appropriations to the parameters agreed upon in the Atlantic Alliance.
IT_M_007	6	Alongside our international allies in supporting Ukraine in the face of aggression by the Russian Federation.
IT_M_007	7	Relaunching the system of European integration, for a Europe of Homelands, founded on the interest of peoples and capable of facing the challenges of our time.
IT_M_007	8	Defense of Europe's classical and Judeo-Christian roots and its fundamental values of freedom, democracy, solidarity, subsidiarity and justice.
IT_M_007	9	"Promote common EU defense policies and the establishment of a ""European pillar"" of NATO, indispensable pillars for the security and independence of the Continent."
IT_M_007	10	Support for our Armed Forces, no job cuts and overcoming precarious employment.
IT_M_007	11	Enhance the educational backgrounds of military academies and schools.
IT_M_007	12	Relaunch of a national policy for Space.

IT_M_007	16	Restore centrality to the Mediterranean in Italian and European policies.
IT_M_007	17	"A ""Mattei formula for Africa"": promoting an ""Italy model"" of investment and development cooperation that respects the environment and peoples."
IT_M_013	1	Industrial chains need to be reorganized through selective incentives to promote supply chains that are strategic for our country.
IT_M_013	2	We also propose the establishment of coordination for enhancing the role and contribution of SOEs in industrial policy strategies, particularly for the green and digital transition.
IT_M_013	3	We must affirm, along the lines of recent European regulations, the right to full economic control of one's data acquired by digital platforms for their use in the delivery of related services.
IT_M_013	4	This applies to citizens but also to platform workers.
IT_M_013	5	We also intend to regulate the use of big data and artificial intelligence: such use must be limited by respecting people's privacy and security leading to a ban on the systematic use of surveillance software, biometric recognition from public places, the use of social scoring systems based on personal data; the use of emotional recognition systems, and the adoption of digital technologies with proven discriminatory effects.
IT_M_013	6	We believe it is essential to promote a critical approach to digital in the education cycle, starting from digital civic education to digital literacy and education on the use of data, the use of basic elements of computer science, and defense against misinformation.
IT_M_013	7	More generally, we believe that industrial policies are needed to develop the digital asset sector, consistent with the European regulatory framework and at the same time seizing the new opportunities that modern blockchain technologies offer.
IT_M_013	8	Being a vanguard in Europe in this area would bring enormous benefits to the country: creation of new, highly skilled jobs, enfranchisement from non-European solutions in strategic areas, and protection and enforcement of citizens' rights.
IT_M_013	9	We believe that in order to develop a virtuous relationship between State, Market and Community, it is necessary to ensure an efficient frontier between competition and universality of services, giving an increasing role to the Third Sector and civic protagonism that animates our communities in the different spheres of civil life.
IT_M_013	10	We want to be the bearers of a vision, comprehensive and not fragmentary, capable of valuing the person within the family, parental and neighborhood networks, intermediate bodies, the various forms of association, mutualism and cooperatives, labor unions, local public services, local small businesses and those that are participatory and responsible, civicism, and municipalism.
IT_M_013	11	We want to revive the strategic vision of public intervention in the many areas of market failure exposed to the exercise of monopolies, abuses of dominant position and cartels, including on a global scale.
IT_M_013	12	We have the tools and they are many, but all based on the same prerequisite: the stability needed to plan investments and strategic choices that look to the future.
IT_M_013	13	This is from the NRP and its reform path abruptly interrupted by the fall of the Draghi government.
IT_M_013	14	This means completing on time the many reforms that Italy has been waiting for - starting with Tax, Justice, Public Administration and Competition - and all the investments envisaged in the NRP, so as not to miss a single one of the opportunities offered by European funding.
IT_M_013	15	We want to support businesses and workers so that they can successfully cope with this difficult phase and reap the full benefits of the major changes that await our economy in the coming years.
IT_M_013	16	We want the green and digital transition to be the main driver for lasting and sustainable growth for all.
IT_M_013	17	Now we must act to transform and make the entire productive and social fabric of the country more solid.
IT_M_013	18	"We want to strengthen the great potential of our businesses, small and women entrepreneurs, innovative start-ups, the world of artisans and professionals, through support and simplification measures, encouraging the ""4.0 transition"" in a scenario that combines innovation, competition and sustainability."
IT_M_013	19	"We want to invest in research and innovation to overcome the inefficiencies and structural problems of low productivity in the ""Italian System."""
IT_M_013	20	We want to take action on reducing household and business energy costs through concrete proposals capable of giving a decisive boost to clean and renewable sources.
IT_M_013	21	Caring for the land also involves the enhancement of protected areas and the protection of biodiversity.
IT_M_013	22	The infrastructure and sustainable mobility investments initiated by the Draghi government will need to be supplemented with new land-cover projects.
IT_M_013	23	We aim to introduce drought plans and design agriculture, livestock and fisheries as drivers of the ecological transition, including by enhancing the digitization of tracking and monitoring processes.
IT_M_018	1	The vision of the M5S in the sphere of international relations is permeated by the same beacon that inspires our entire political program: the promotion of a new humanism that places at the center the dignity of the human person, his inalienable rights, his quest for well-being and his legitimate aspirations with full respect for the environment and ecosystems of which he is a part, within the framework of the sustainability of each of its dimensions therefore, as much environmental as economic and social, in order to fully decline the concept of integral ecology.
IT_M_018	2	"Such a perspective in order to be effective in providing answers to the great challenges of our time, starting with the fight against climate change, the steady growth of various forms of inequality, and the erosion of respect for the rule of law in multiple areas of our planet, must necessarily be cultivated and promoted in a dimension that is not exclusively national and European but genuinely global, holistic and universal, so that such momentum and propensity can be not only of encouragement and support for all those courageous activists and activists who daily fight, risking their own safety and lives, to defend democracy and human rights denied and trampled upon by authoritarian and oppressive regimes but which at the same time guarantees a constant openness to growth and positive contamination through interaction with political experiences, inspired by the same values, that have matured or are maturing in other areas of the globe, in a positive sense of globalization of rights and not of markets, to use the words of Stefano Rodotà or better yet of ""glocalization"" of rights that knows how to preserve the individual identities of communities within the broader complex system represented by our planet, without harming the individuality and the right to exist of the identities themselves with their own specificities within the framework of that system."
IT_M_018	3	The M5S recognizes in this horizon two polar stars, two fundamental and inalienable pillars of Italian foreign policy: on the one hand, our pro-European vocation, rooted in the principles and values that constitute the very essence of the European integration process as inspired by Altiero Spinelli's Ventotene Manifesto and the Founding Fathers.
IT_M_018	4	A pro-Europeanism ambitious in its goals but not superficial in its analysis, which aims to revive the founding reasons of the European construction site by definitively overcoming the short-sighted and narrow meshes of the austerity policies of recent decades, through the consolidation of the instruments inaugurated to deal with the dramatic economic and social consequences of the pandemic, above all the issuance of common European debt and the Next Generation EU, relaunching a greater protagonism of Italy aimed at strengthening and deepening the process of European integration itself, for too many years culpably stalled because it has fallen victim to the trap of unanimity and the logic of crossed vetoes; on the other, the centrality of our country's membership in the Atlantic Alliance, which remains essential in order to guarantee the security and defense of our Continent,.
IT_M_018	5	A membership, however, that must be fully reconciled with the development of greater strategic autonomy for the EU in these fields as well, which is also absolutely necessary to achieve a consolidation of the European pillar within the Alliance itself, which through increased cohesion, interoperability, efficiency and effectiveness will be able to strengthen its capabilities in order to respond to the growing challenges in our eastern and southern neighbors, with a view to operating better when we can act together, and still being able to fulfill our responsibilities as Europeans when synergistic action will not be possible.
IT_M_018	6	Our program is thus hinged around seven key priorities: a decisive revival of multilateralism as an antidote to counter the current marked trend toward multipolarism increasingly oriented toward a return to dangerous power logics; a more proactive approach by Italy in the so-called enlarged Mediterranean, a region that has always constituted our priority geopolitical area of interest; a further strengthening of our country's commitment to international cooperation efforts for sustainable development and the promotion of human rights in order to achieve the goals of the UN SDGs by 2030; renewed Italian support for the consolidation of the international justice system and the role of the International Criminal Court in the fight against impunity; a greater presence of the system-Italy in the Western Balkans, a crucial region not only because it is adjacent to our peninsula and linked to it by deep historical, political, economic and cultural ties but also with a view to the acceleration of the in function of the inescapable Italian support to the process of its integration within the EU, the only perspective capable of definitively reconciling the communities existing there after the tragic wars of the last century; a strengthening of the rights of our fellow citizens living abroad combined with a more effective promotion of the Italian language and culture; finally, the willingness to raise Italy to a leading role in the efforts by diplomats to organize a Peace Conference that facilitates a negotiating process capable of achieving and cessation of the hostilities originated by the criminal invasion of Ukraine by Russia perpetrated by the Russian Federation, in order to spare no effort in the arduous but necessary attempt to recover the spirit of détente and cooperation of the Helsinki Conference of 1975.
IT_M_019	1	In line with the most virtuous examples in major advanced economies, the competitiveness of our production system needs to be revitalized, thereby triggering a structural shift toward high value-added economic activities.
IT_M_019	2	The peculiar historical moment the country is experiencing, coupled with the need to direct existing and future resources toward the most pressing challenges, such as ecological transition and digital transformation, demand a rethinking of national industrial policy.
IT_M_019	3	This scenario offers an opportunity to create a new innovation ecosystem between the public and private sectors that fosters long-term investment in higher-risk sectors and triggers a virtuous process of value creation in the economic system.
IT_M_019	4	One of the main cornerstones of the new industrial strategy will have to be the strengthening of interaction between universities and manufacturing.
IT_M_019	5	In this regard, it is necessary to strengthen not only basic research, but also institutions in charge of applied research and technology transfer.
IT_M_019	6	In addition, it is crucial to focus intervention tools within an overall strategy, within which incentives accompany direct investments, for example in strategic areas such as steel, automotive, aerospace, hydrogen systems and telecommunications.
IT_M_019	7	The industrial challenges facing the country in the immediate future concern the resolution of corporate crises of systemic impact and the revitalization of sectors in structural difficulty, but also investment in activities crucial to the competitiveness of the Italian economy in its near future.
IT_M_019	8	It is important to enhance the systemic potential of state-invested enterprises, including through the introduction of a new governance model, which could foster dialogue on common issues (energy, digital, engineering technologies, logistics and transportation) for the coordination of business plans and the adoption of new initiatives, based on existing international models, among them the French model of the Agence des participations de l'État.
IT_M_019	9	The availability of resources and the experience of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, moreover, can be leveraged to encourage the growth in size of Italian companies, a process of evolution that has been highlighted as necessary for many years, so that they can compete effectively in international markets and boost the demand for skilled labor and research and development activities.
IT_M_019	10	Dedicated funds and financial instruments of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, such as the Patrimonio Rilancio, can be used to create a true Italian Sovereign Wealth Fund, which can attract private savings and channel them to Italian small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the lack of financial resources from channels other than bank debt is often a fundamental obstacle to growth.
IT_M_019	11	Support for diversification of business financing sources can also make use of tools such as the introduction of guarantee mechanisms to encourage the acquisition and strengthening of in-house skills, such as those related to the development of European and national funds dedicated to SMEs.
IT_M_019	12	In the same vein, we intend to adopt interventions that encourage business aggregation processes, particularly in supply chains projected onto foreign markets, including through a reform of the Aggregation Bonus.
IT_M_019	13	It is also desirable to implement interventions to capitalize small and medium-sized enterprises in defense of acquisitions from abroad, as well as measures geared toward facilitating the inclusion of Italian companies in the new value chains being created in Europe, starting with the European Commission's new Projects of Common Interest (PCIs).
IT_M_019	14	In order to protect listed companies against potential hostile takeovers from abroad, it is more necessary than ever to introduce dedicated regulatory tools, such as through instruments like the extension of golden power and multiple voting for those who ensure a long-standing presence in the shareholder base.
IT_M_019	15	With a view to greater internationalization of SMEs, it is also essential to work on strengthening local and foreign chambers of commerce.
IT_M_019	16	"The pandemic crisis has demonstrated the importance of a high level of strategic country autonomy in the production and supply of ""critical"" goods and services that are vital to the very continuity of economic activity and the social fabric."
IT_M_019	17	On this front, we need to develop a systematic and up-to-date mapping of the country's production matrix and its relations with foreign countries, identifying the sectors in which the national presidium of strategic segments needs to be filled.
IT_M_019	18	With reference to the most promising developments for the ecological transition, a national strategy on the hydrogen supply chain should be implemented, aimed at the production of electrolyzers and the preparation of energy storage and distribution systems.
IT_M_019	19	There is also a need to prepare a revitalization strategy for the future of automotive in Italy, with a specific assessment of the effects of recent transnational mergers, and for the coordination of investments in space and aerospace.
IT_M_019	20	Finally, in order to make the system of state and local investee companies, now pulverized into too heterogeneous and often loss-making entities, more efficient, we intend to launch a plan to integrate major national strategic hubs.
IT_M_019	21	Snam and Terna, for example, in the area of energy transportation carriers; Eni and Enel, in energy production and the provision of services to citizens and businesses; Leonardo and Fincantieri, in the aerospace and large shipbuilding orders; important companies, with a great deal of experience behind them, which could in some cases also integrate downstream with entities, such as multi-utilities, held by regional and municipal governments.
IT_M_019	22	A vertical and horizontal integration that would help overcome Italian dwarfism and concentrate strategic, industrial and research investments in sectors that require new and more important capital and a greater ability to respond to the needs of citizens right away.
IT_M_023	1	From April 2021 to date, the single national price of electricity (PUN) has increased from 41 euros/MWh to 500 euros/MWh and gas from 20 euros/MWh to over 200 euros/MWh.
IT_M_023	2	The trend signals uncontrollable exponential growth.
IT_M_023	3	Europe is lagging behind, but Italy cannot afford to chase Europe's delays.
IT_M_023	4	It is absolutely urgent to reform the mechanisms for setting the PUN, taking into consideration the real average cost of the available generation stock (deleting the so-called marginal price).
IT_M_023	5	The M5S was the first in Italy to stress the need to reach a European agreement on the Gas price ceiling, because it is clear that price indexing to the Dutch TTF is in the grip of speculative mechanisms.
IT_M_023	6	A path is needed to generate suitable financial resources and intervene, with greater courage and determination, in striking at the numerous speculations in various business sectors (pharmaceuticals, insurance, as well as oil and gas trading) that have manifested themselves in this emergency phase so as to operate a redistributive mechanism in favor of the less-insured segments of the population.
IT_M_023	7	The strongest cause for concern right now is our heavy dependence on Russian gas.
IT_M_023	8	As of February 2022, gas imported from Russia was about 40 percent of our national needs, prompting the government to take extraordinary actions, such as reactivating old coal-fired power plants and regasification plants, as well as reinforcing the intensity of extraction from traditional fossil deposits of our natural heritage.
IT_M_023	9	However, these are operations that mark an abrupt return to the past, with no vision open to the future.
IT_M_023	10	"In this way we are under the illusion that we are ""plugging"" an immediate need, but we will end up throwing away considerable financial resources that would instead prove invaluable in ferrying us, more quickly, to a future entirely designed on energy and environmental sustainability."
IT_M_023	11	For this reason, we intend to further limit any new drilling on Italian territory by defining and adopting Plans for Sustainable Energy Transition of Eligible Areas (PiTESAI), so that employment and land development are preserved.
IT_M_023	12	Considering that our storage capacity remains very high (we have strategic reserves of about 14 billion cubic meters of gas) and that during the past few months there has been a concrete possibility of increasing gas imports through secure routes (such as the agreements closed with Algeria to increase gas exports through the Transmed pipeline), it is worthwhile to focus immediately on increasing energy production from renewable sources and decreasing consumption through energy efficiency and energy saving measures, which are the only path that guarantees us a solid and sustainable strategic autonomy, even in the near future.
IT_M_023	13	Let's start right away with the willingness of the Association of Renewable Plant Operators, who have already now declared themselves ready to install 60 GW in the next three years: this means being able to have the equivalent of the output of 20 large gas-fired power plants in a short time.
IT_M_023	14	In these hours, rather than introducing bureaucratic simplifications to bring old power plants, equipped with obsolete technologies and polluting productions, back on track, let us focus our efforts on introducing some structural changes to reduce energy costs and further simplifications that would allow us to activate, quickly, these new renewable plants.
IT_M_023	15	We can thus achieve savings of 15 billion cubic meters of gas each year by giving up 20 percent of the gas imported so far.
IT_M_023	16	Confirming that the green transition creates new jobs, this project is expected to create about 80,000 new jobs.
IT_M_027	1	Security and countering illegal immigration.

NL_005	1	EU summit:
NL_005	2	'I cannot say whether there will be a solution,' Merkel says at start of third day
NL_005	3	EU leaders failed to break the deadlock after two days of talks on the trillion-euro COVID-19 rescue package and will return to the negotiating table Sunday.
NL_005	4	By putting the talks on a third day, European Council President Charles Michel hopes to find a compromise among the 27 heads of state and government that has so far proved elusive.
NL_005	5	"Michel, who is chairing the summit, is expected to unveil new proposals ahead of Sunday's meeting to bridge the gap between the ""thrifty four"" countries - Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden - and other countries that do not want to see major cuts and conditions added to the recovery fund."
NL_005	6	'Ready to compromise'.
NL_005	7	To conclude the third day of marathon talks, Michel met with Germany's Angela Merkel, France's Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
NL_005	8	"Macron said on Twitter that France and Germany ""stand together"" on an ""unprecedented recovery plan."""
NL_005	9	"""We are willing to compromise without giving up our ambition."
NL_005	10	"Everyone has to take their responsibilities,"" he added."
NL_005	11	"Merkel meanwhile told reporters that she could not say ""whether there will be a solution"" and that ""it is possible that there will be no results today."""
NL_005	12	"""There is a lot of good will, but there are also a lot of different positions,"" she said."
NL_005	13	Dividing lines.
NL_005	14	"The previous evening, as talks between the leaders concluded, Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte described ""the clash"" between his position and that of his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte as ""very difficult."""
NL_005	15	"The Dutch, along with the other ""Frugals,"" favor a larger share of repayable loans rather than subsidies, and they want more conditions and control over how the money is spent."
NL_005	16	A new plan Michel presented early Saturday was designed to make concessions to the Dutch position.
NL_005	17	"The recovery fund, which had originally cost €500 billion to be provided as subsidies, was reduced to €450 billion and an ""emergency brake"" was added to the mix."
NL_005	18	It would have allowed a member state to stop disbursing funds until EU leaders met to discuss how money was being spent in another member state.
NL_005	19	"For Conte, the emergency brake is ""not very practical"" from a legal and political point of view."
NL_005	20	Rule of Law.
NL_005	21	There were further tensions over adding a legal conditionality to access to funds.
NL_005	22	The proposed measure, supported by Macron and others, could mainly affect Eastern European countries, especially Poland and Hungary.
NL_005	23	Warsaw and Budapest have drawn the ire of Brussels in recent years and have been condemned by the European Court of Justice for what are considered attacks on the independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press and the treatment of refugees in Hungary.
NL_005	24	Hungary has threatened to veto the recovery package if such conditions are added to it.
NL_005	25	"But on Sunday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told reporters, ""What is going on is a bit strange because there is a 100 percent agreement on the rule of law."
NL_005	26	"""If someone is not ready to accept the rule of law, he/she should leave the European Union immediately."
NL_005	27	"It should not be punished with money or anything other than saying ""goodbye son, goodbye boys,"" because this community is based on the rule of law."
NL_005	28	"And we like that approach, it's ok, ""he said."
NL_005	29	For the leaders of countries hardest hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus, especially around the Mediterranean, there is no time to waste in getting a package to strengthen the eurozone economies.
NL_005	30	The EU budget commissioner warned that the pandemic is not over.

NL_010	1	"US submarine ""nuclear apocalypse"" enters Mediterranean Sea as warning to Kremlin"
NL_010	2	The USS Rhode Island, the world's largest nuclear submarine, left the port of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain last week.
NL_010	3	It was last seen entering the Mediterranean Sea and heading south toward the Black Sea as a warning to the Kremlin.
NL_010	4	"Britain's Daily Express newspaper said the nuclear submarine, also called ""the horseman of the apocalypse,"" is under ""intense protection"" from the Royal Marines as it reportedly heads toward the Black Sea."
NL_010	5	The departure of the USS Rhode Island comes as fears grow over what Vladimir Putin will do after what the mainstream media continue to call a retreat.
NL_010	6	"Captain John Craddock , the commander of the US Navy's Task Force, said earlier this week, ""Rhode Island's port visit to Gibraltar reinforces our ironclad commitment to our allies and partners in the region."""
NL_010	7	"""The US and UK share a strong history of cooperation, through exercises, operations and cooperative activities such as this, which strengthen our combined capabilities and partnership."
NL_010	8	"The complexity, lethality and tactical expertise of Rhode Island embodies the effectiveness and strength of the submarine force, ""Craddock added."
NL_010	9	Yesterday, the Russian president called on citizens to leave Cherson in southern Ukraine because of the advancing counteroffensive against the occupied city.
NL_010	10	Officials and Russian commanders installed by the Kremlin in the occupied region were seen fleeing as the Ukrainian counteroffensive pushed south.
NL_010	11	Putin's regime has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine was planning to detonate a dirty bomb - an explosive laced with radioactive material - that intelligence officials believe is a precursor to a false flag operation.
NL_010	12	The USS Rhode Island is an Ohio-class submarine and can therefore patrol continuously as a highly effective tool for NATO's nuclear deterrent force and could be directed to a strategic position near the Black Sea.
NL_010	13	It could be an obvious, outwardly visible display of the progress of this war, and the insistence of the United States and the United Kingdom to ignite into something greater than it already is.

NL_010	16	Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev has arrived in Tehran for a meeting with senior Iranian officials, the agency reported Tuesday.
NL_010	17	According to IRNA, Patrushev arrived for an official visit at the invitation of Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council.
NL_010	18	"Apart from talks with his Iranian counterpart, the Russian security chief plans to meet with Iranian ""high-ranking political and economic officials to discuss issues of developing bilateral relations and cooperation in the international arena,"" the agency said, adding that Patrushev accompanied officials from several Russian economic bodies."

NL_011	1	On climate skepticism, Thierry Baudet articulates a sentiment that is widely held
NL_011	2	"So it was the ""climate election after all,"" just as Jesse Klaver predicted at the Green Left party conference last month."
NL_011	3	And those elections showed that the Netherlands is much less concerned about the climate than it sometimes seems.
NL_011	4	The party that became the largest (FvD) has an openly climate skeptical party leader and sees climate policy as a waste of money.
NL_011	5	Thierry Baudet's climate skepticism and his lament on ambitious climate policies are massively dismissed by virtuous commentators, columnists and Twitter users.
NL_011	6	Yet Baudet articulates a sentiment that is widely held.
NL_011	7	This was evident much earlier than last week's election results.
NL_011	8	Reports by the Social and Cultural Planning Agency have shown this for years.
NL_011	9	SCP researchers who poll the mood of the country every quarter routinely ask about the most important problems in the Netherlands.
NL_011	10	"The percentage that spontaneously mentions words like ""climate,"" ""sustainability"" or ""energy"" has hovered around 1 percent for a decade."
NL_011	11	"Young people in particular, raised on alarmist tales of global warming, appear to take ""little to very little"" interest in it."
NL_011	12	We are quite willing to recognize climate change as a problem, it appears, and it may cost something to do something about it, but it should not get too crazy.
NL_011	13	Investing in improving healthcare, education, security, mobility and residential neighborhoods can count on much more support, as can extra money to fight poverty, unemployment and terrorism, or stimulate research and technology.
NL_011	14	"Even improving ""water protection"" can count on twice as much support as ""addressing international environmental problems and climate change,"" according to the SCP."
NL_011	15	That both the Cabinet and various opposition parties have bet with such vigor on an issue that has so little resonance in the country has proven to be a major misstep.
NL_011	16	"After endless sessions at Ed Nijpels' climate tables on ""the biggest rebuilding of the Netherlands since World War II,"" it turns out that we're not really into it at all."
NL_011	17	Forum for Democracy was the only one to get that right.
NL_011	18	In 2016, SCP surveyed views on the energy transition.
NL_011	19	"Less than half think it has been ""convincingly demonstrated"" that burning coal, oil and gas has a major impact on the climate."
NL_011	20	"In support of the energy transition, climate considerations appear to play ""only a minor role""; air pollution, resource scarcity and dependence on politically unstable regions are seen more as a problem."
NL_011	21	This is possibly why FvD advocates expanding nuclear power.
NL_011	22	After all, nuclear power plants do not pollute the air and use uranium that is abundant on Earth.
NL_011	23	That nuclear power plants also don't emit CO2 should leave Baudet completely cold.
NL_011	24	The SCP showed something else that was confirmed at the polls.
NL_011	25	"There is widespread agreement that most people only want to switch to renewable energy ""if it doesn't cost them anything extra."
NL_011	26	The prospect of a billion-dollar bill - which Baudet multiplied yet again for his own costing - will not have helped rally support for climate policy.
NL_011	27	"And then, according to the SCP, we are also wary of ""getting ahead of the music internationally."
NL_011	28	Now what?
NL_011	29	To calm the minds of society, we must discuss the energy transition honestly and soberly, that is, the pros and cons of all energy sources, acknowledging limitations and risks.
NL_011	30	"Thus, the ""climate fools"" will have to acknowledge that no country has yet succeeded in bringing down CO2 emissions sharply and affordably with a full commitment to wind and solar power."
NL_011	31	To shape the energy transition, the Netherlands should rely more on what reputable knowledge institutes have long claimed.
NL_011	32	To drastically reduce CO2 emissions and prevent further global warming, we must approach issues rationally and pragmatically.
NL_011	33	Don't rule out options.
NL_011	34	Apply technologies where they are appropriate.
NL_011	35	Provide predictable, stable policies.
NL_011	36	Facilitate research and development.
NL_011	37	Inform the population so they can distinguish sense from nonsense.
NL_011	38	Minimize costs.
NL_011	39	Distribute costs and benefits fairly.
NL_011	40	Meanwhile, politicians must learn the art of weighing priorities and holding society together.
NL_011	41	After FvD's resounding election victory, the task has only grown larger and more complex.

NL_015	2	Robert F.
NL_015	3	Kennedy Jr. warns: do not take COVID-19 vaccine under any circumstances If you are even considering getting vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), Robert F.
NL_015	4	Kennedy Jr. a message for you: don't do it!
NL_015	5	The nephew of former President John F. Kennedy recently issued a public statement urging people everywhere to avoid the COVID-19 shot at all costs because it contains an untested new technology known as mRNA, whose long-term side effects are completely unknown.
NL_015	6	"mRNA directly changes the genetic material of those who receive it, much like what happens when ""scientists"" eat genetically modified (GMO) food crops such as soybeans or corn to make them resistant to insects or drought."
NL_015	7	"""This intervention can be compared to genetically modified foods, which are also very controversial,"" Kennedy said."
NL_015	8	"Unlike all other vaccines, whose genetic damage is not necessarily permanent, genetic damage to mRNA is ""irreversible and irreparable,"" Kennedy notes."
NL_015	9	"""Even though the media and politicians are currently downplaying the problem and even foolishly calling for a new type of vaccine to get back to normal, this vaccination is problematic in terms of health, morality and ethics, but also in terms of genetic damage,"" Kennedy said."
NL_015	10	"Kennedy: COVID-19 vaccines are a ""crime against humanity"" Unlike older vaccines, many of which can be ""detoxified"" after injection, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines live forever in the body."
NL_015	11	In other words, the damage they cause is forever.
NL_015	12	"""You will have to live with the consequences, because you will no longer be able to be cured by simply removing toxins from the human body,"" Kennedy explained, comparing the genetic damage to the type that causes Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis."
NL_015	13	"mRNA is almost like a continuous vaccine ""engine"" that repeatedly vaccinates a person for the rest of his or her life."
NL_015	14	"As a result, there is no way to ""fix"" or ""cure"" any problems that arise."
NL_015	15	"""This clearly means: if a vaccine symptom develops after an mRNA vaccination, neither I nor any other therapist will be able to help you, since the damage caused by this vaccination will be genetically irreversible,"" Kennedy warns."
NL_015	16	"Not since the actual Holocaust has such evil been forced upon the world in the name of ""public health."
NL_015	17	"COVID-19 vaccines are not only unsafe, Kennedy argues, but they also represent a ""crime against humanity never before committed in history in such a significant way."""
NL_015	18	"""As the experienced physician Dr."
NL_015	19	Wolfgang Wodarg said: actually, this' promising vaccine 'should be banned for the vast majority of people because it is genetic engineering!
NL_015	20	""" In other words, being vaccinated against COVID-19 means that a person becomes a kind of GMO zombie, without the ability to return to his old self."
NL_015	21	It sounds very much like the mark of the beast from the book of Revelation, don't you agree?
NL_015	22	In the past, Kennedy, considered by many to be the best Kennedy, has warned that traditional vaccines are bad enough and cause severe brain damage that is irreversible for many.
NL_015	23	And Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19)-vaccines are much worse than that, he says, which is why no one should use them under any circumstances.
NL_015	24	"""Study the history of vaccination, from Jenner to Pasteur to Polk,"" wrote one Strange Sounds commentator."
NL_015	25	"""There is no evidence that they are doing anything other than injecting you with (at best) part of the virus."""

NL_017	2	Okay, even Trump called on his entourage in Alabama this weekend to get vaccinated, but emphasized that it should be a free choice and people should stick to those freedoms.
NL_017	3	But then Biden yesterday.
NL_017	4	Following the full FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine, he called all (!)
NL_017	5	US companies to mandate vaccine for staff.
NL_017	6	"Vaccination requirements were already in place for federal government personnel and will soon apply to the entire U.S. Biden's new call reminds us strongly of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's call on Aug. 2, when he asked businesses to """"""refuse"""""" unvaccinated customers."
NL_017	7	A day later, it was announced that vaccination would become mandatory in the following weeks for entry to restaurants, gyms, cinemas, etc.
NL_017	8	"In short, start the time, because now the wait is on until every U.S. state (except Texas and Florida) encouraged by Biden's ""demand"" follows in New York's footsteps and mandates vaccination for access to sociability."
NL_017	9	And then we put these developments next to the below most hallucinatory Australian newsrepo since the and, of course, after the break, next to that of pharma zealot Trudeau.
NL_017	10	Everything about this is sicker than corona.
NL_017	11	Until a little over half a year ago, the US seemed to me to be quite a nice country to visit once, but with this guy in charge, even Hungary looks more prosperous.
NL_017	12	Oh well, saves a lot of money on vacation too.
NL_017	13	If only it were based on scientific data but it is not.
NL_017	14	Vaccinated people spread just as well or worse.
NL_017	15	I understand that it takes the pressure off of hospitals as the health of many americans is in embattled state but then hammer on a healthier lifestyle.
NL_017	16	This opens the box of pandora and the way to further infringement on your bodily integrity and life atmosphere of everyone in the western world.
NL_017	17	Why is it that trumpie was always dismissed as a fascist when his goal was always to guarantee individual freedoms.
NL_017	18	Biden may not say or tweet anything offensive but it is the senile assassin of individual freedoms.
NL_024	1	Reading and getting read
NL_024	2	Last week, white smoke finally came out of the Weyts administration's chimney:
NL_024	3	schools open with code yellow.
NL_024	4	This means that all of our students - barring a new large corona fire - can return to school full time on Sept. 1.
NL_024	5	The decision offers perspective and hopefully motivation to principals, teachers, students and their parents.
NL_024	6	This motivation will be much needed given the learning deficit that many children and youth experienced last school year due to the school closure.
NL_024	7	Language impoverishment.
NL_024	8	On top of this, long before corona was even in the country, there were alarming signals coming from the education field.
NL_024	9	For years we have been struggling with language impoverishment among our youth, and certainly in the area of reading comprehension we are in a sinister downward spiral.
NL_024	10	The latest PIRLS survey, which compares the reading levels of fourth-grade students internationally, found that the level of reading comprehension in our education system declined sharply in both relative and absolute terms.
NL_024	11	The most recent PISA results signal the same decline in relation to reading comprehension in our secondary education; a negative trend that is also confirmed by the Flemish Reading Poll.
NL_024	12	Recently, the Flemish education inspectorate also sounded the alarm.
NL_024	13	Their annual Education Mirror 2020 report shows that 44 percent of elementary schools do not spend enough time on effective reading time.
NL_024	14	Moreover, one-third of elementary schools have one-sided or outdated reading offerings.
NL_024	15	Furthermore, their bulletin also shows that in less than half of the elementary schools, reading is done in all classes.
NL_024	16	In addition, half of the schools do not pay attention to thoughtful reading didactics.
NL_024	17	The painful conclusion is that children usually only read when there is time to spare.
NL_024	18	Low literacy.
NL_024	19	The causes of the decline in the level of reading comprehension among our youth are diverse and not solely attributable to education.
NL_024	20	A director of the Center for Dyslexia, Diverse Learners, and Social Justice in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA clearly emphasizes the negative impact of digital media on children's reading behavior.
NL_024	21	Wolf links the growing low literacy among young people to the fleeting and distracting digital media that addicts our brains to temptations with quick rewards.
NL_024	22	"Children and young people can no longer bring themselves to concentrate on a ""boring"" book for long?"
NL_024	23	because on the smartphone or tablet, everything is more fun and faster.
NL_024	24	With the increased use of digital media, young people no longer manage to read a text calmly and in depth and employ a reading strategy where they filter the text superficially.
NL_024	25	As a result, the deeper meaning of written texts is lost.
NL_024	26	Wolf argues, however, that we can no longer think away from digital media.
NL_024	27	She is not making a plea to throw out all smartphones and tablets, but believes we need to teach our young people the difference between written texts and digital information, between scanning and skimming.
NL_024	28	To really learn to read well, it is important to encourage contact with real books.
NL_024	29	A good school library and regular classroom visits to a public library are of lasting value in this regard.
NL_024	30	Language and literacy skills.
NL_024	31	"In the field of reading, the old Flemish proverb ""words awaken, examples draw"" also applies ."
NL_024	32	Children need to enjoy reading and this can be encouraged early on.
NL_024	33	Parents do well to read to their children at a very young age.
NL_024	34	These moments are not only a moment of connection between parent and child, but also bring children into physical contact with books.
NL_024	35	Reading to children a lot expands and deepens their vocabulary.
NL_024	36	They are encouraged to ask questions of the narrator which helps them understand the story better and better.
NL_024	37	Furthermore, parents who read regularly themselves are role models for their children.
NL_024	38	After all, research shows that children who grow up in a home with more than 500 books spend an average of three years more in education and are more likely to earn a college degree than children who grow up in a book-poor environment.
NL_024	39	This finding is independent of parental education level and home financial situation.
NL_024	40	Sufficient language and literacy skills are important prerequisites for functioning well in society.
NL_024	41	Education, as well as parenting, plays an important role here.
NL_024	42	Let the children read, but lead by example yourself.
NL_024	43	Learning to read does not come naturally: it is an effort that eventually, given practice and experience, merges with relaxation.
NL_024	44	Children's reading skills and enjoyment of reading do not simply grow in a sterile educational vacuum, but need a stimulating environment.
NL_024	45	Therefore, make time for reading both in class and at home.
NL_024	46	Reading time is never lost time.
NL_027	1	New tech allows government to access car and wireless devices via your smartphone, including those of others
NL_027	2	Permanent technocratic control of everything and everyone already a reality within a few years.
NL_027	3	"The technological grip of governments on their subjects will become ever more powerful in the coming years as new technology has been developed that allows your smartphone to be used, without your knowledge, as a kind of ""hub"" to access all your other devices, such as car, computer and home or business security system, as well as your possible pacemaker."
NL_027	4	It can also locate devices of others around you.
NL_027	5	The US Air Force Research Lab recently signed a contract with the SignalFrame company to test this new software.
NL_027	6	"The Wall Street Journal writes that smartphones will be used ""as a window into the use of hundreds of millions of computers, routers, fitness meters, modern cars and other networked devices, known collectively as the 'Internet of Things.'"
NL_027	7	Your smartphone effectively becomes a government eavesdropping device.
NL_027	8	It detects all nearby other wirelessly (WiFi and bluetooth) accessible devices.
NL_027	9	How big the maximum distance is spokesmen for the company and the lab did not want to say, but with the introduction of 5G it can be assumed that it is more than just a few meters.
NL_027	10	Within a few years, the government can: not only know your exact location via GPS, but also what you are doing there, and with whom; find out via your smartphone how many other participants there are at a meeting, demonstration or gathering you are attending; take over your car's onboard computer, turn off the electricity, lock the doors and force your car to stop, until the police have arrived (because you are suspected of an offense or the like. or worse, gain access to your pacemaker; switch on your laptop's camera or the microphone of your 'Alexa' device without your knowledge, thus eavesdropping on you; switch off or on devices connected to the 'internet of things', such as your private security cameras, your oven/microwave, your heating ('smart meter'), etc.; * using 5G to collect, transmit and process incredible amounts of data from you in real time, after which A.I. systems can assess at lightning speed whether you are complying, or whether you might become a threat (to anyone or anything); using the same A.I. and advanced algorithms to crack all your passwords.
NL_027	11	Permanent total control.
NL_027	12	If the U.S. is doing this, no doubt China, Europe and Russia will be as well.
NL_027	13	"This new technology, including 5G, is presented in the media as something wonderful that is going to make our lives even ""easier,"" yet seems to be primarily intended to give governments total 24/7/365 control over their subjects so that all dissident voices, even potential ones, can be located and eliminated in advance."
NL_027	14	Needless to say, nothing at all will be left of our freedoms and privacy.
NL_027	15	The infamous top man of the WEF, Klaus Schwab, has even already announced the next step .
NL_027	16	"Within 10 years, people who want to cross the border will be given brain scans to determine if they are a potential ""danger,"" and (almost) everyone will have implanted microchips, which will be required to participate in all aspects of normal life."
NL_027	17	Even our thoughts and feelings will then no longer be our own, and will then be able to be controlled ánd manipulated.
NL_034	1	Impending caregiving crisis:
NL_034	2	Not because of war, but thanks to green ecological goals
NL_034	3	Starting in 2023, farmers will be forced to shut down 4% of their land.
NL_034	4	Most people think that increasingly expensive and scarce food would only be a problem of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
NL_034	5	In reality, however, this only reinforces deeper-seated problems.
NL_034	6	Admittedly, grain reductions from Ukraine also affect Germany.
NL_034	7	However, the main problem is ideological prescriptions from the EU, which wants to force the expansion of ecological agriculture - and needs more and more land.
NL_034	8	Less grain due to compulsion of fallow land.
NL_034	9	A relevant EU action plan for this agro-economic structural change was already presented a year ago; as a result, one fourth of the agricultural land in the EU is to be used for organic farming by 2030.
NL_034	10	However, because the land requirement for this is more than 40% more than conventional agriculture, farmers should be forced to shut down 4% of their land, among other things, starting in 2023.
NL_034	11	This misdirection is already casting its shadows in an impending reduction in grain production.
NL_034	12	Too few truck drivers: delivery shortages and empty shelves.
NL_034	13	Apart from that, the currently rising prices for key food and consumer goods are attributed as in a reflex to the Ukraine war.
NL_034	14	"As for logistical problems caused by the political situation, there is, of course, no doubt about the connection; Dirk Engelhardt, the chief of the national organization for logistics and waste handling goods traffic (BGL), said, ""Right now we are 80,000 truck drivers short, in five years there will be twice as many."""
NL_034	15	This could lead to supply shortages for parts of the economy.
NL_034	16	"""That also means empty shelves in supermarkets."""
NL_034	17	"This ""special influence Ukraine"" may be available - but it is only temporary."
NL_034	18	The worse evils for scarcity, inflation and increasing welfare dependence from abroad also among staple foods in the long run are threatened mainly by green drawing board agricultural politicians in Brussels.
NL_034	19	And: also in Germany itself.
NL_034	20	Solar panels and windmills instead of fields.
NL_034	21	For what is not ruined by EU interference, German politics itself takes care of that: to speed up the catastrophic energy transition, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck (Greens), for example, is speeding up the expansion of wind turbines and solar panels.
NL_034	22	Huge amounts of farmland must also give way for this.
NL_034	23	Protected areas for agriculture demanded.
NL_034	24	"The president of the farmers' organization, Joachim Rukwied, said, ""In the last 30 years, we have lost a total of about 1.3 million hectares, which is almost half the area of the state of Schleswig-Holstein."""
NL_034	25	"Therefore, he demands ""protected areas for agriculture."""
NL_034	26	More and more farmers are turning fields and acreage into wind farms and parks of solar panels - with the result that less is grown and produced, and due to ecological regulations, in addition, yields per unit of land are still massively reduced.
NL_034	27	Do not simply limit food production.
NL_034	28	The insanity of this development has since been realized by the opposition.
NL_034	29	"For example, CDU politician Gitta Connemann says, ""We do not need less production, but more production."
NL_034	30	"Shutting down fields and pastures must be stopped!"""
NL_034	31	And former Agriculture Minister Julia Klöckner (CDU), in view of the production cuts temporarily caused by the Ukraine war, is also demanding a different way of thinking from the EU.
NL_034	32	"""Priorities should be rearranged - one should not simply slow down the necessary production of food and contribute to the rise in prices."
NL_034	33	"New times require new decisions."""
NL_034	34	"Bavaria's Agriculture Minister Michaela Kaniber (CSU), in a strategy document, argues against expanding production in Germany because, based on the enormous dependence on supplies of key food products from abroad, one could become ""blackmailable."""
NL_034	35	However, the country has long been that - and not just in terms of food and grain ...
NL_039	1	Ukraine has a new president.
NL_039	2	On Monday, actor and television producer Volodimir Zelenski took the oath of office with his hand on the Constitution.
NL_039	3	"""In my career so far, I have done everything to make Ukrainians laugh,"" Zelenski spoke after the solemn ceremony at the parliament in capital Kiev. [...]"
NL_039	4	For the first time, it became clearer how the new president intends to do it.
NL_039	5	Thus, he asked parliament to pass laws to make it possible to prosecute sitting politicians, which is now impossible.
NL_039	6	He also wants to revisit the law against self-enrichment by high-ranking officials, which failed under the current government.
NL_039	7	Finally, he wants more transparency in the compilation of electoral lists to reduce the grip of oligarchs on parliament.
NL_039	8	Problem for Zelenski is his lack of support in parliament.
NL_039	9	Although his newly formed Servant of the People party is by far the most popular in the polls, parliamentary elections are not scheduled until the fall.
NL_039	10	Therefore, in his speech, he also said he wanted to dissolve the People's Assembly, aiming for an earlier ballot in late July.
NL_039	11	The question is whether that will happen.
NL_039	12	Because one of the coalition parties left the government last week, a new coalition must formally be forged first.
NL_039	13	"""Do it."
NL_039	14	"You will earn medals,"" Zelenski admonished the wavering politicians."
NL_039	15	Ending war with Russia.
NL_039	16	In addition to the fight against corruption, Zelenski again made ending the conflict with Russia a top priority.
NL_039	17	"""We did not start the war but we must end it,"" the new president said."
NL_039	18	"""I am not afraid of difficult decisions and am willing to give up my position to achieve peace."""
NL_039	19	In the same vein, Zelenski vehemently denied that he wants to give up Crimea, annexed by Russia, or the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas as Ukrainian territory.
NL_039	20	He does want to talk with the eastern neighbor, he added, with the first point of discussion being the release of dozens of Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia.
NL_039	21	Now that he has taken office as president, it will soon become clear who Zelenski will work with.
NL_039	22	To the satisfaction of EU envoys, he appointed a number of prominent reformers as advisers.
NL_039	23	At the same time, it fed fears that oligarch Igor Kolomojski will have a finger in his future policies.
NL_039	24	The wealthy businessman, who owns the television channel on which Zelenski broadcasts his television shows, returned to Ukraine a few days ago after hiding abroad for two years following allegations of business malpractice.
NL_039	25	Andrei Portnov, who is a senior adviser to former President Yanukovych and figures on international sanctions lists, also landed at Kiev airport last weekend after five years in exile.
NL_039	26	Zelenski strongly denies that there is anything more than a business relationship with Kolomojski, and about Portnov he said nothing Monday morning.
NL_039	27	However, he did invite the millions of Ukrainian migrants to return to their country and promised them Ukrainian citizenship.
NL_039	28	"""We need you guys badly,"" he said."
NL_039	29	"""Don't bring souvenirs, but your knowledge and experience."
NL_039	30	"Then together we will begin a new era."""
NL_039	31	Immediately after the announcement of the first polls, Zelenski entered the hall in Kiev where hundreds of journalists were waiting for him.
NL_039	32	"""We achieved this result together,"" he thanked his team."
NL_045	1	Beginning of political year A public spectacle on sneakers Every year the Cabinet kicks off in jeans.
NL_045	2	The image Rutte III wants to portray: things are going well.
NL_045	3	Eric Wiebes stood on a mountain in the Georgian Caucasus this summer.
NL_045	4	It was halfway through an exhausting hike, and he marveled.
NL_045	5	"""You think you are halfway there, but then you still have a long way to go,"" says the Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate (VVD) in the garden of the leafy Oisterwijk hotel Bos en Ven."
NL_045	6	"""Like the climate agreement, actually."""
NL_045	7	Climate, pensions, the labor market: the cabinet has made a start after two years of government, but there is still plenty to do in the next two years.
NL_045	8	Plans must be put into practice, citizens convinced.
NL_045	9	Still, a feathery optimism prevails among Rutte III's ministers at the annual healing session.
NL_045	10	This time, no turmoil over the dividend tax (2018) or looming refugee crisis (2015) to spoil the joint summer getaway.
NL_045	11	The prevailing feeling: it took a while, but the momentum is there.
NL_045	12	The heath day should confirm that feeling, and preferably thicken it.
NL_045	13	The ministers and secretaries of state gathered in an informal setting, chatted with the press and posed for a photo of themselves with the handful of local residents who had flocked.
NL_045	14	Is there nothing wrong then?
NL_045	15	Still.
NL_045	16	Behind the scenes, officials at several ministries are working hard on emergency solutions for housing, roads, businesses and farmers now that the State Council has drawn a line under the government's lenient nitrogen program.
NL_045	17	The cabinet is toiling over a mission to the Strait of Hormuz.
NL_045	18	"The climate agreement must now be actually implemented, ""quite a journey"" in Wiebes' words."
NL_045	19	And though the economy continues to grow, for many Dutch people, the burden is falling little to not at all.
NL_045	20	These are thorny issues, but not ones on which the opposition can easily challenge the Cabinet.
NL_045	21	Much of the opposition is busier with itself.
NL_045	22	At the Party for the Animals, MP Femke Merel van Kooten-Arissen left out of dissatisfaction with the party's direction.
NL_045	23	The SGP is struggling with a revolt by empowered young people against the aging administration.
NL_045	24	GreenLeft is not yet over the hangover from the departure of Zihni Özdil.
NL_045	25	That the fuss at Forum for Democracy is even bigger - splitting off senators, departing Statesmen - at best gives them some breathing room.
NL_045	26	There is no sign of a close opposition, like the one that formed earlier around the dividend tax and the climate agreement.
NL_045	27	The Cabinet, on the other hand, went into the summer better.
NL_045	28	The majority in the Senate was lost in June, but the reception of the pension agreement and the climate agreement showed that it is quite possible to work with the opposition.
NL_045	29	Master of his own genre.
NL_045	30	The relative calm is paying off.
NL_045	31	Even before the summer, the leaders of the cabinet parties took a preview of the next two years.
NL_045	32	They want to make new plans, possibly break open the coalition agreement (road pricing, explicitly rejected in the coalition agreement, is up for discussion again).
NL_045	33	After the summer, those consultations should continue, but in Oisterwijk, those prospects are far away - as far away as the impending battle for leadership at both CDA and D66.
NL_045	34	In Oisterwijk, no suits but polo shirts, no policy documents but jokes, shoulder pats and musings on past vacations.
NL_045	35	"""Did you actually go out?"""
NL_045	36	State Secretary Stientje van Veldhoven (Infrastructure and Waterways, D66) asks Mona Keijzer (Economic Affairs, CDA).
NL_045	37	The fair-weather show bears the signature of the prime minister, who first turned the traditional cabinet outing into a public spectacle and remains the master of his own genre.
NL_045	38	It is he who comes trotting in last at the photo opportunity on the steps of the hotel.
NL_045	39	And when the ministers dawdle afterwards for entrance, it is Rutte - in Asics shirt, jeans and Converse shoes - who drives them back inside through the doors of the Hotel Bos and Ven.
NL_045	40	The pictures are taken, with the image is fine.
NL_051	1	Dutch journalist expelled from Turkey over suspicion in terrorism investigation
NL_051	2	According to the prosecution, Boersma is a suspect in the Netherlands in an ongoing criminal investigation into terrorism.
NL_051	3	In the process, several suspects are in the crosshairs.
NL_051	4	In doing so, Boersma is not suspected of a crime of terrorism, by the way, but is suspected of other crimes.
NL_051	5	Turkish police arrested Boersma yesterday as she sought to extend her visa at the immigration office in Istanbul.
NL_051	6	After a night in jail, she was put on a plane to the Netherlands Thursday morning.
NL_051	7	According to a prosecutor's spokeswoman, Boersma was not detained upon arrival at Schiphol Airport.
NL_051	8	She would not say whether the journalist was questioned.
NL_051	9	According to a spokesman for President Erdogan, Turkey acted after a tip-off from Dutch police.
NL_051	10	The latter allegedly revealed that Boersma had ties to the Syrian terror group Al-Nusra.
NL_051	11	"""If a trusted foreign government agency tells you that one of its citizens has ties to terrorism, you don't take any chances."""
NL_051	12	Also, according to Ankara, the Dutch police allegedly asked for information about Boersma's travel habits.
NL_051	13	Not asked for rendition.
NL_051	14	Furthermore, according to Turkey, the ball is now in the Netherlands' court.
NL_051	15	"""Only the Dutch authorities can explain how they reached their conclusion."
NL_051	16	"We will not speculate on the reliability of their intelligence."""
NL_051	17	In the Netherlands today, on the contrary, there was initially much uncertainty about the expulsion.
NL_051	18	The Foreign Ministry referred to the Public Prosecutor's Office for comment, but that organization did not come out with a statement until the afternoon.
NL_051	19	In it, she admitted that she had indeed asked Ankara for information about Boersma, but had not specifically requested her deportation or extradition.
NL_051	20	And then suddenly you're on a plane back to the Netherlands.
NL_051	21	Declared undesirable person in Turkey.
NL_051	22	Because of the initial lack of a Dutch explanation, MPs initially suspected that Boersma had been deported because of her work as a journalist.
NL_051	23	They wanted Foreign Minister Stef Blok to summon the Turkish ambassador to demand the journalist's return.
NL_051	24	"After all, Turkey does often arrest journalists under the banner of ""ties to terrorists."
NL_051	25	In many cases, those ties consist of little more than maintaining normal journalistic contacts with an organization that Ankara believes is a terror group.
NL_051	26	The eviction also caused surprise at first because it happened so suddenly.
NL_051	27	Just a week earlier, Boersma had received a new press pass, and her papers would have been in order.
NL_051	28	In Turkey, she worked mainly as a correspondent for the Financieel Dagblad, but she also wrote pieces for Trouw.
NL_051	29	After the arrest, she was also not allowed to visit home to pack her belongings.
NL_051	30	With only the items she was carrying at the immigration office at the time, she had to leave the country immediately.
NL_051	31	It is possible the Cabinet will provide further clarification Wednesday night.
NL_051	32	There is then an already scheduled House debate on foreign policy and the EU in which Stef Blok or development minister Sigrid Kaag will be present.
NL_051	33	Several House members have said they want to use this debate now to ask for an explanation of Boersma's expulsion.
NL_051	34	Read also: Can Turkey control Syrian refugee town of Afrin?
NL_051	35	The Syrian offensive in rebel stronghold Idlib will trigger an exodus of refugees, according to the UN.
NL_051	36	The northern region of Afrin is a logical but unstable destination.
NL_051	37	Ans Boersma made a report for Trouw in September in the hard-to-reach area.
NL_051	38	Dutch politics is united in its dislike of Erdogan.
NL_051	39	All Dutch political parties have their own reasons for disapproving of the Turkish government's policies.
NL_051	40	Because of this anti-Turkish mood, there is hardly any room for normal foreign policy toward Ankara.
NL_051	41	Will Erdogan stay afloat even now that the economy is down for the first time?
NL_051	42	The eviction also caused surprise at first because it happened so suddenly.
NL_058	1	Column:
NL_058	2	Right-wing policies are winning
NL_058	3	Left and right.
NL_058	4	When the national and international media discuss politics, certain government policies have traditionally been frequently characterized as right-wing or left-wing.
NL_058	5	Due to social and economic developments, as well as the fragmentation of the political landscape, these old political terms have lost much of their sharpness.
NL_058	6	Moreover, we are increasingly surprised by surprising developments.
NL_058	7	For example, we saw recently in the House of Representatives that a motley crew of left and right-wing parties voted against the European Trade Treaty with Canada.
NL_058	8	Nevertheless, the terms left and right continue to be widely used; especially as elections approach.
NL_058	9	In addition to Johnson who has clearly chosen right-wing policies, we see in the US that Donald Trump is using right-wing policies to secure his re-election.
NL_058	10	In the run-up to the March 2021 elections to the House of Representatives, right-wing and left-wing policies are also increasingly making headlines in the Netherlands.
NL_058	11	Rough sketch.
NL_058	12	We already indicated that left and right in politics can no longer be sharply defined.
NL_058	13	If we look at the election programs of European left-wing and right-wing political parties in recent decades, there are important differences.
NL_058	14	These are particularly striking in the view of government revenue and government spending.
NL_058	15	Roughly speaking, we see on the left a preference for higher government spending, especially on social security, health care and lower incomes.
NL_058	16	These parties also favor bigger government, leveling, and tax increases for higher incomes.
NL_058	17	In addition, large corporations must pay substantially more taxes.
NL_058	18	On the right, we see the opposite in broad terms, such as smaller government, less leveling, lower taxes and more business-friendly policies than on the left.
NL_058	19	In the area of immigration, the right opts for containment and the left for a generous policy.
NL_058	20	"When it comes to climate policy, we see that the left generally plays a pioneering role and the right tends to act as a ""brakeman"" and opponent of an ambitious climate policy."
NL_058	21	Netherlands.
NL_058	22	Last week, pollster Maurice de Hond noted an increase in polarization between left and right in politics in the Netherlands.
NL_058	23	We see this not only with climate policy but also when it comes to the possible cooperation of other parties with the PVV and FVD.
NL_058	24	In his poll, De Hond also posed the question of what should happen if the results in the upcoming elections to the House of Representatives show major splintering.
NL_058	25	In that case, 58% of voters are okay with exploring the possibility of forming a government with FVD, PVV or FVD+PVV.
NL_058	26	For VVD and CDA, the figures are 66% and 59%, respectively.
NL_058	27	Green Left and Labour Party voters are not in favor of this (but around 20%).
NL_058	28	Prediction.
NL_058	29	We do not venture a prediction of the composition of a new cabinet after March 2021, nor about left and right policies of this new coalition.
NL_058	30	But based on current international trends that are also visible in the Netherlands, the likelihood of a policy dominated by the right is higher.
NL_058	31	"However, history shows that the ""voter climate"" is unpredictable and that this climate can be totally reversed in a year's time."
NL_058	32	Therefore, all political parties still have plenty of time to influence voters.
NL_068	1	Taliban in Afghanistan Secretary of State Mahdi on evacuations from Afghanistan:
NL_068	2	"""Priority given to Belgians, then people who have ties to us"""
NL_068	3	Update 55 min
NL_068	4	Evacuating people of Belgian nationality from Afghanistan is now the first priority.
NL_068	5	"So says State Secretary for Asylum and Migration Sammy Mahdi in ""The News"" and ""Terzake."""
NL_068	6	It also looks at people who have a connection to our country in some way.
NL_068	7	How all those people are supposed to get to the airport without being stopped by the Taliban is not clear, though.
NL_068	8	470 Belgians as well as relatives.
NL_068	9	So many people are currently asking our country to be evacuated from Afghanistan.
NL_068	10	"""The priority today is to make sure that all Belgians in Afghanistan are evacuated,"" said Secretary of State Mahdi."
NL_068	11	"""That also only makes sense."
NL_068	12	You have to make sure your own subjects are safe.
NL_068	13	"Sometimes they have a partner or children of Afghan origin, they are included."""
NL_068	14	There are also many people in Afghanistan who have a connection to our country in one way or another.
NL_068	15	Think of people who have worked as interpreters or fixers with our defense services or people working in international or European organizations.
NL_068	16	Requests to evacuate are also currently coming in from them.
NL_068	17	"""These include individuals from people's or women's organizations."
NL_068	18	Certainly the latter will be targeted by the Taliban.
NL_068	19	"We need to be very focused on ensuring that they too can be evacuated."""
NL_068	20	How many people are involved, the secretary of state knows, but would not say.
NL_068	21	"""We depend on a lot of parameters."
NL_068	22	You know when you can fly the first time - now Friday - but not when the next time.
NL_068	23	"This is not the time to throw numbers around."""
NL_068	24	"Watch the first part of the interview with Sammy Mahdi on ""Terzake"" here, in which he talks about the evacuation of Belgians."
NL_068	25	Either way, evacuating all those people will be a feat.
NL_068	26	No one who really seems to know how to get those people to the airport without being checked - or stopped - by the Taliban.
NL_068	27	"""It's particularly chaotic, but in that context we have to work."""
NL_068	28	What exactly people who want to be evacuated will then have to do, Mahdi could not say.
NL_068	29	Many Belgians in Afghanistan are currently criticizing the Belgian government.
NL_068	30	There was a late response and even now they get little info, it sounds.
NL_068	31	"""The government has been saying since Aug. 7 that people were better off not staying in Afghanistan,"" the secretary of state said."
NL_068	32	"""A lot of people even left afterwards, to visit family or a wedding party."
NL_068	33	That's unfortunate.
NL_068	34	It all happened very quickly, even for those people.
NL_068	35	"Now we have to try to get everything in order as soon as possible."""
NL_068	36	Separately, quite a few Afghans may flee the country in the coming period.
NL_068	37	In doing so, Mahdi advocates shelter in the region, in neighboring countries.
NL_068	38	"""There they should have protection, children should be able to go to school and people should be able to work."
NL_068	39	I hope the European Commission understands that we need to strengthen the external borders of Europe and that we need to screen people there and that there is solidarity among the member states.
NL_068	40	"Whoever arrives here and needs protection, we will give protection by all means."""
NL_071	1	DNA profiles China takes toddlers in Tibet blood for dna database 17:11
NL_071	2	In Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, blood was systematically drawn from children in kindergartens in order to include children's dna profiles in Chinese police databases.
NL_071	3	This is according to a report released Monday by the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) on increased police surveillance of residents of Tibet and of Tibetan communities within China.
NL_071	4	In a Tibetan community in the western province of Qinghai, blood was drawn from all boys aged five and older in 2020, according to a Chinese report.
NL_071	5	"""There is no publicly available evidence to suggest that people can refuse to participate,"" HRW said."
NL_071	6	The organization also found no information indicating that people whose blood is drawn are under concrete suspicion of a crime.
NL_071	7	This makes the collection of genetic material from Tibetans seem like an extreme case of ethnic profiling: because people have Tibetan ethnicity or live in Tibet, they are by definition suspected of being a danger to the stability of Chinese society.
NL_071	8	They are seen as potentially dangerous to the state.
NL_071	9	Therefore, China wants to capture their dna in a database as early as possible.
NL_071	10	Police in other parts of China have also been collecting dna since the beginning of the last decade, but there the tool seems to be less widely used.
NL_071	11	According to HRW, this usually involves groups that the police see as problematic, including migrants, former prisoners and crime suspects.
NL_071	12	However, according to an official document that HRW was shown, a program has been running in China since 2017, collecting dna from possibly over a quarter of all men in China.
NL_071	13	In 2019, the police called on interested parties in Tibet through a tender to submit proposals to build a regional dna database.
NL_071	14	"An official Chinese report described such a database as necessary ""for the agencies in charge of public security to detect illegal business and effectively act rain illegal and criminal elements,"" HRW quoted the tender for the project as saying."
NL_071	15	Government goes further and further.
NL_071	16	The Chinese government is going further and further in collecting personal data to maximize state and Party control over its citizens.
NL_071	17	In doing so, the government focuses on those ethnicities it most suspects of terrorist sympathies.
NL_071	18	For example, HRW reported back in 2017 that western China's Xinjiang is working on a database containing the dna of all residents between the ages of 12 and 65.
NL_071	19	Xinjiang is home to many Ugurs and other minority peoples who are predominantly Muslim.
NL_071	20	They are potentially at least as dangerous as Tibetans in the eyes of the Chinese government.
NL_071	21	International attention to the position of Tibetans in China has declined in recent years, in part because Tibet, part of the People's Republic of China, is virtually inaccessible to independent observers and journalists.
NL_071	22	HRW relies primarily on Chinese-language written sources that are publicly available in this report.
NL_073	1	With 80,000 job openings, every newcomer is an opportunity
NL_073	2	There are 83,000 vacancies in Flanders, a quarter more than last year.
NL_073	3	At the same time, only 58.9 percent of non-EU citizens in Flanders are employed .
NL_073	4	The employers' organization Voka gives several reasons why this is so.
NL_073	5	"""They don't have the right competencies."
NL_073	6	'They don't understand or speak enough Dutch.'
NL_073	7	'Belgium has too little labor migration and too many refugees who have other priorities.'
NL_073	8	In summary, they are not the right people for the right jobs.
NL_073	9	Is that right?
NL_073	10	No, the numbers show.
NL_073	11	Commissioned by the city of Ghent, the University of Ghent, under the direction of professor of labor economics Stijn Baert, conducted field tests on the Ghent labor market in various sectors.
NL_073	12	The researchers used correspondence tests in which two applicants respond to the same job posting via e-mail.
NL_073	13	The resume and cover letter they send are almost identical, but the candidates differ in one characteristic.
NL_073	14	The author; Astrid De Bruycker is alderman for Equal Opportunities in Ghent (Vooruit).
NL_073	15	The issue; Flanders has more than 80,000 job openings, but few non-Belgians are working.
NL_073	16	The proposal; Tackle discrimination in the workplace and throw open the doors to people who want to learn Dutch and new skills.
NL_073	17	Every newcomer is an opportunity.
NL_073	18	This examined whether Selin or Hamza were less likely to receive a positive response from an employer than Annelore or Joachim.
NL_073	19	The tests showed that people from immigrant backgrounds do experience a lot of discrimination.
NL_073	20	They receive 16 percent fewer invitations even if they have equally strong profiles and resumes.
NL_073	21	All the right people for the right jobs.
NL_073	22	They are competent potential employees who do not have the opportunity to present themselves to an employer.
NL_073	23	What society can afford such a waste of talent?
NL_073	24	Certainly not a society with more than 80,000 job openings.
NL_073	25	When will Flanders face this injustice and introduce structural field testing?
NL_073	26	When will the employers' organization Voka cease its resistance to these field tests?
NL_073	27	The 16 percent who are not invited and society as a whole will benefit.
NL_073	28	Fighting discrimination will go a long way in helping us, but it will not be enough.
NL_073	29	Not all newcomers match well with the vacancies, for example, because they do not know enough Dutch.
NL_073	30	But they are in our country and will stay here.
NL_073	31	Isn't it a waste if we don't engage with these people?
NL_073	32	Isn't it strange to import other labor from abroad?
NL_073	33	It is vindictive that just now the Flemish government wants to make learning Dutch pay for newcomers?
NL_073	34	With 80,000 job openings, we cannot expect to have a ready-made white raven ready for every position.
NL_073	35	We need to broaden our view by having people on the job learn Dutch and provide in-service training.
NL_073	36	Remove discrimination from our work floors and throw open the doors to people who want to learn Dutch and new skills.
NL_073	37	Every newcomer is an opportunity for our society.
NL_073	38	Don't ignore them.
NL_078	1	Rwanda 'Suspicious death' of rare critical journalist in Rwanda Rwandan journalist John Williams Ntwali died in a traffic accident, according to police, but human rights groups question that.
NL_078	2	The death of a critical journalist in the Rwandan capital Kigali is arousing suspicion among human rights groups.
NL_078	3	One of the few journalists who was critical of the Rwandan government is dead.
NL_078	4	John Williams Ntwali was killed in a motorcycle accident in the capital Kigali last week, according to police, but human rights groups and foreign journalists question that.
NL_078	5	Critics of President Paul Kagame are more often arrested or threatened, or go missing. attended Ntwali's funeral on Sunday, according to the BBC.
NL_078	6	Police said the journalist was killed instantly when the motorcycle cab he was on was hit by a car Tuesday night, but are not releasing further details.
NL_078	7	"Human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) demands an independent investigation into his ""suspicious death."""
NL_078	8	"""There are many reasons to question the theory of an accident and it is essential that investigations be conducted quickly, using international expertise to determine whether or not he was murdered,"" on his website."
NL_078	9	Ntwali was editor of the newspaper and ran the YouTube news channel Pax TV - IREME News .
NL_078	10	Among other things, he reported on politically-motivated trials of journalists and opposition figures, and posted videos of their conditions in prison.
NL_078	11	His latest video is from Jan. 17 and deals with the disappearance of a genocide survivor who said he was mistreated by police.
NL_078	12	Ntwali previously spoke of staged accidents he had survived.
NL_078	13	"""I get calls from private numbers."
NL_078	14	Intelligence officers are coming to my house.
NL_078	15	"NISS [National Intelligence and Security Services] said to me, 'If you don't change your tone, you'll see what happens to you,'"" he told HRW last June."
NL_078	16	He was also regularly threatened and attacked in the pro-government media because of his revelations.
NL_078	17	Opposition members.
NL_078	18	"""John Williams Ntwali was a lifeline for many victims of human rights abuses and often the only journalist who dared to report on issues of political persecution and repression,"" HRW Central Africa Director Lewis Mudge said on his organization's website."
NL_078	19	Present at his funeral were other Rwandan journalists and opposition figures, including Victoire Ingabire, who spent 16 years in the Netherlands as a political refugee .
NL_078	20	"""We will never forget your valuable contribution to promoting freedom of media and expression in a challenging environment,"" Ingabire said during her speech."
NL_078	21	This weekend, an outspoken journalist from Cameroon and an activist from Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, were also killed.
NL_078	22	Cameroonian journalist Martinez Zogo has been found dead in the capital Yaoundé after going missing since Tuesday.
NL_078	23	He had recently made a broadcast about an alleged embezzlement case involving top officials.

NL_079	1	Migration Inquiry: Italy sends asylum seekers handcuffed on ferries back to Greece Once again, Italy is violating international law by pushing asylum seekers back to Greece.
NL_079	2	As recently as 2014, the country was condemned in Strasbourg for the same practice.
NL_079	3	In the caverns of a ferry belonging to the Greek shipping company Superfast Ferries, a man is handcuffed to a pole.
NL_079	4	It is a migrant who had taken the boat to Italy from Greece with the plan to seek asylum there.
NL_079	5	The Italian authorities wanted none of this and sent him, tied up, back to Greece.
NL_079	6	A photo showing the handcuffed man was made public Wednesday by journalist collective Lighthouse Reports, in cooperation with ARD and Al Jazeera, among others.
NL_079	7	Their investigation shows that Italy regularly sends asylum seekers back to fellow EU member country Greece in this way.
NL_079	8	The asylum seekers in question, from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, boarded ferries in Greece that took them to the Italian port cities of Venice, Ancona, Bari and Brindisi.
NL_079	9	The Italian authorities sent them back to Greece on the same boats.
NL_079	10	According to Greek data, this would have happened to over two hundred asylum seekers in the past two years.
NL_079	11	The investigation shows that the asylum seekers, including children, were sometimes held for more than a day at a time in unofficial, lower-deck prisons, which take the form of dark rooms or metal boxes with only a piece of cardboard on the floor.
NL_079	12	One case involved a former bathroom with broken showers and toilets, with two mattresses in it.
NL_079	13	Names and dates of inmates were scrawled on the walls in various languages.
NL_079	14	The same boats carried paying passengers above deck.
NL_079	15	Illegal.
NL_079	16	It is not the first time this has happened.
NL_079	17	Back in 2014, a similar case was at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
NL_079	18	"Then, too, they were asylum seekers who, in 2007 and 2008, were sent back to Greece upon arrival at an Italian port, and then, too, their freedom of movement was restricted on the return trip: ""Throughout the journey, some applicants were confined in cabins and others in toilets,"" the Court said, ruling that this pushback practice between EU member states is illegal."
NL_079	19	Asylum seekers have the right to individual treatment of an asylum application.
NL_079	20	But Italy is not processing that application and is sending the asylum seekers back collectively, indiscriminately.
NL_079	21	Under the Dublin system - a European treaty that determines which country is responsible for processing asylum requests - no form of collective arbitrary deportation is justified, the court said.
NL_079	22	"Italy still argued in that case that under ""Dublin"" the first country of arrival in the Union is responsible for processing asylum claims."
NL_079	23	But the court ruled that for Italy to reach that conclusion, it must assess the asylum seekers' situation individually, rather than deporting them collectively.
NL_079	24	Additional checks.
NL_079	25	Italy said at the time in response to the ruling that it would cease this practice.
NL_079	26	It has not kept that promise, according to the journalists' investigation.
NL_079	27	Following the 2014 Strasbourg ruling, additional monitoring of Italian border processes in the port cities involved was instituted from Europe.
NL_079	28	Italy, according to Lighthouse, has repeatedly called for an end to those checks, saying the violations would no longer take place.
NL_079	29	For now, the Italian government has not responded to the latest revelations.
NL_079	30	In an interview with ARD, Giovanni Signer, police director of the city of Bari, denied all allegations.
NL_079	31	Every asylum seeker who arrives in his city receives an appropriate procedure, Signer said.
NL_079	32	This is contradicted, also at ARD, by Erminia Rizzi, legal adviser for asylum and migration in Bari.
NL_079	33	According to her, border police completely screen incoming refugees before returning them to ships.
NL_080	1	Elections Portugal Premier Costa rewarded for economic recovery Portugal
NL_080	2	The Socialist PS led by Prime Minister António Costa received more than a third of the vote on Sunday.
NL_080	3	2 min. read
NL_080	4	António Costa (58) may call himself the leader of Portugal's largest party for the first time after Sunday night's elections.
NL_080	5	However, a dreamed-of absolute majority remained out of reach for the Socialist Party (PS).
NL_080	6	With more than a third of the vote, Costa will have to again seek support from one or more other parties for a second term.
NL_080	7	Attendance did reach an all-time low.
NL_080	8	Nearly half of Portugal's 10.8 million voters stayed home.
NL_080	9	Costa profiled himself during the election campaign as the leader of a government that had kept promises.
NL_080	10	"He managed to collect the ""prime minister's bonus"" after a strong first term."
NL_080	11	Costa surprised friend and foe in 2015 by forming a government with the help of the Left Bloc and Communists, which took over after the swift fall of a center-right coalition.
NL_080	12	"From ""Brussels,"" in particular, it was noted with some concern that after years of harsh austerity, Portugal had become partially dependent on Euroskeptics."
NL_080	13	The fear of failure proved unfounded.
NL_080	14	Socialist Costa managed to pull the southern European country out of a deep crisis with social policies.
NL_080	15	A new positivism was emerging in Portugal, which had still seen nearly half a million citizens leave abroad between 2011 and 2014.
NL_080	16	The metamorphosis occurred on several levels.
NL_080	17	The 2016 European Football Championship win was the first in a series of unexpected, positive events.
NL_080	18	A year later, Portugal won the Song Contest.
NL_080	19	Heavy forest fires, which claimed more than 100 lives, did put a huge gray veil over the successes.
NL_080	20	Sample nation.
NL_080	21	Costa's government turned the EU's problem child into a model nation for socialists from other European countries.
NL_080	22	Thus Pedro Sánchez, as Spain's outgoing prime minister, looks with envy at the support Costa does receive from other leftists.
NL_080	23	Portugal, in times of the Brexit, rising populism, unpredictable terrorism and separatism in Catalonia, is a balanced nation where foreign guests feel at ease.
NL_080	24	Tourism grew into one of the main pillars of the economy.
NL_080	25	Costa, with the help of Mário Centeno as finance minister, managed to get the economy growing again.
NL_080	26	Centeno was awarded the presidency of the Eurogroup in 2018.
NL_080	27	The socialists played high stakes by refraining from new cuts, but the unexpected miracle happened anyway.
NL_080	28	The economy picked up thanks in part to investment, unemployment fell sharply and both the budget deficit and public debt went down.
NL_080	29	The minimum wage was raised.
NL_080	30	Citizens regained confidence and dared to demand more with a series of demonstrations.
NL_080	31	The conservative PSD is the big loser with a quarter of the vote and, as the second party, condemned to the opposition again.
NL_088	1	'Police should mandate bodycams, now too non-committal'
NL_088	2	"""We choose to put the professionalism of our colleagues first,"" responded Theo van der Plas, responsible at the police for the introduction of bodycams."
NL_088	3	"""The incidents they deal with cannot all be captured in a protocol."
NL_088	4	"We value an officer's assessment of the situation."""
NL_088	5	He gives an example.
NL_088	6	"""One neighborhood cop says: a bodycam helps me tremendously in my work."
NL_088	7	But there are also neighborhood agents who say: me just not, because the young people with whom I want to make contact are suspicious of it.
NL_088	8	It is then a conscious choice not to wear a bodycam.
NL_088	9	"We shouldn't start imposing that."""
NL_088	10	That includes officers who go off on 112 calls, he says.
NL_088	11	"""In certain neighborhoods, a filming agent might actually create additional tension."
NL_088	12	"We have well-trained police officers who can judge for themselves whether the bodycam is necessary."""
NL_088	13	The standard retention period for bodycam images is 28 days.
NL_088	14	Van der Plas does not believe agents will deliberately erase images because of a complaint.
NL_088	15	"""But it's possible, then, that the camera wasn't on."
NL_088	16	"We're not going to mandate that."""
NL_088	17	By no means all police officers appear to have a practical use for a camera on their vest.
NL_088	18	"The police's own evaluation states that ""a large group"" is critical of the bodycams."
NL_088	19	Flight also noticed this during his research in Amsterdam.
NL_088	20	"""The first question I got everywhere was, 'Can that image be used against me?'"
NL_088	21	If I'm very honest: yes, you can.
NL_088	22	"But I can hope that if the police do something that is not acceptable, they still want to learn from it so that it is prevented in the future."""
NL_088	23	In the United States, where police use bodycams extensively, they are always on by default.
NL_088	24	There is an essential difference from the Netherlands, however, Flight says.
NL_088	25	"""In America, bodycams were introduced to protect citizens from police brutality, here they are there to protect police from angry citizens."""
NL_088	26	He himself believes that the bodycam does not have to be on by default, but, for example, always when an officer addresses someone in a corrective manner.
NL_088	27	"""After all, you never know which interaction is going to escalate."""
NL_088	28	Arms race.
NL_088	29	Civil rights activists previously warned that police bodycams are an invasion of privacy.
NL_088	30	"""A bodycam violates our privacy less than a surveillance camera, which films everything on the street,"" Flight believes."
NL_088	31	"""Because bodycams also have demonstrable positive effects and they only film the person facing the officer, I think they are actually much more proportionate as a tool."""
NL_088	32	Still, there are drawbacks to using the cameras, he warns.
NL_088	33	"""One risk is that we get a kind of arms race in filming."
NL_088	34	"Citizens film the police, the police film the citizen back."""
NL_088	35	And that while images are far from saying everything.
NL_088	36	They can even cause confusion if the context is missing.
NL_088	37	"""In many situations, it makes sense that something doesn't go perfectly."
NL_088	38	By filming that, you also magnify it.
NL_088	39	"There is a risk that images will carry so much weight that they come at the expense of trust in the police."""
NL_088	40	Policeman Van der Plas is not so afraid of that.
NL_088	41	He believes that with bodycam footage, police are actually better able to tell the complete story.
NL_088	42	"""We have had several instances where only a piece of an incident came out."
NL_088	43	A colleague gets hit, then deals a blow himself, and only the latter is on YouTube.
NL_088	44	"The bodycam can help tell our part of the story as well."""
NL_089	1	This is how to move women into politics
NL_089	2	One hundred years after the introduction of universal suffrage, women are still underrepresented in politics.
NL_089	3	While representation of both men and women is important for the support of decision-making, say political scientists and activists working for more diversity.
NL_089	4	Role models that break the traditional image of the white, male politician can contribute to emancipation.
NL_089	5	Readers on emancipation: 'Family policy is medieval' The husband of Wilma Berkhout (66) of Helmond never discriminates .
NL_089	6	"Still, when he received a phone call after surgery and heard a female voice, he immediately said, ""But I thought the surgeon would call himself?"""
NL_089	7	He was later shamed to death, Berkhout writes.
NL_089	8	In the week the Netherlands celebrates 100 years of women's suffrage, NRC asked readers: how do you think women's emancipation will fare in 2019?
NL_089	9	What should happen next?
NL_089	10	And: when will women's emancipation actually be complete?
NL_089	11	Nearly 500 readers responded to our call , the vast majority of whom (73 percent) were women.
NL_089	12	More than 85 percent of all participants think the feminist struggle in the Netherlands is still relevant.
NL_089	13	"""Still there is violence, still women are discouraged from reporting, still women care more than men,"" writes Lily Talapessy (51, The Hague)."
NL_089	14	"Asked why women are still underrepresented in high positions in politics and business, the ""old boys network"" is mentioned numerous times."
NL_089	15	Men choose men, many write.
NL_089	16	"Others blame it on a ""baby fine."
NL_089	17	"""The policies in place regarding families are truly medieval; parental leave is a JOKE and child care is bizarrely poorly regulated,"" Nicole Peters (33) believes."
NL_089	18	American Melissa Raczak (45) has been living and working in the Netherlands (Maarssen) for twenty years.
NL_089	19	She stresses that the culture must change.
NL_089	20	"""Women here are still looked down upon when they work full-time or more than four days a week."""

NL_093	2	'Underlying was the economy crawling out of the downturn, but the virus and measures to contain it will lead to a pause in the recovery.
NL_093	3	We can expect a lot of downward earnings revisions in the coming months, with all the nervousness that this entails.
NL_093	4	The saying goes then that as an investor it is better to sit still when you are being shaved.
NL_093	5	You can, however, be ready to pick up sectors that have taken hits as soon as the knife is on the ground (an allusion to 'never catch a falling knife,' ed.).

NL_093	20	Stock markets will only stabilize when the wave of selling stops, not because of a return of buyers.
NL_093	21	We may not get a clear recovery in the stock markets until a week after the peak of the epidemic.
NL_093	22	First, it must be truly tangible that the peak is behind us.
NL_093	23	That could take weeks.

NL_093	26	But it has a long incubation period.

NL_093	37	"We may get a fairly solid recovery in the second quarter, although that will depend on the evolution of the coronavirus and on the ""damage cases."
NL_093	38	The quality of many corporate balance sheets is deteriorating, and for a number of companies the virus could well be the death knell.
NL_095	1	'Factory of the world' lies idle, so Europe fears shortages
NL_095	2	Throughout China, factories are shut down because of the coronavirus.
NL_095	3	"And with it, the production of the ""factory of the world"" stalls."
NL_095	4	That prospect is causing unease among investors and among Dutch companies.
NL_095	5	Of the world's 500 largest companies, 300 have factories or offices in the metropolis of Wuhan, considered the source of the virus.
NL_095	6	Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province have been hermetically sealed because of the deadly virus.
NL_095	7	Dutch companies such as Philips, ASML and Arcadis also operate there.
NL_095	8	The sudden standstill in the world's second largest economy is already having a negative impact as well.
NL_095	9	Stock markets around the world suffered heavy losses this week.
NL_095	10	The prices of oil and other commodities went down, and shares of airlines, for example, also did poorly.
NL_095	11	We stopped by a medical device manufacturer that probably won't get any products delivered until Feb. 10:
NL_095	12	"""In terms of timing, the virus comes at a very unfortunate time,"" said Onno de Jong, transport consultant at Ecorys."
NL_095	13	Last week was Chinese New Year, so many factories were closed.
NL_095	14	"""In planning, European companies are counting on catching up with freight traffic next week."""
NL_095	15	But because of the corona virus, most Chinese businesses will remain closed at least until Feb. 9.
NL_095	16	And more and more major airlines such as KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways are also discontinuing flights to and from China.
NL_095	17	A week of no production in China can shut down entire industries in Europe.
NL_095	18	For example, the Wuhan region is home to many auto parts manufacturers.
NL_095	19	These go by boat, plane or train to the European factories of Volkswagen, Peugeot or Volvo, for example.
NL_095	20	"""Those factories have only a week's supply for parts from outside Europe,"" said Erik Groot Wassink, who is responsible for rail traffic from China for transport company Nunner Logistics."
NL_095	21	"""If no work is done in Wuhan for more than a week, they will be in trouble."
NL_095	22	"If two or three parts are missing, they can't finish the whole car."""
NL_095	23	Economic damage coronavirus likely greater than SARS.
NL_095	24	China was ravaged by the SARS virus in 2003.
NL_095	25	That virus also caused economic setbacks in China.
NL_095	26	But it is likely that the global economy will be hit harder by the new coronovirus, Rabobank economists write.
NL_095	27	In 2003, China accounted for only 7.5 percent of global GDP; today it already accounts for 20 percent of the global economy.
NL_095	28	China is also much more connected to the global economy.
NL_095	29	The impact on the global economy is therefore likely to be greater than 17 years ago, the economists write.
NL_095	30	The stocks currently in China may not be able to prevent the shortages.
NL_095	31	"""You actually see that all forms of freight transport from China are affected,"" De Jong said."
NL_095	32	Train traffic is at a standstill in large part because Wuhan is important.
NL_095	33	Less and less can also be transported by air.
NL_095	34	"""Cargo planes will continue to fly, but the cargo carried in the belly of passenger planes is seriously declining,"" said Maarten van As, of Air Cargo Netherlands."
NL_095	35	With price increases as a result.
NL_095	36	Consequences sometimes not apparent until months later.
NL_095	37	"""Only the ocean liners are all still sailing,"" De Jong said."
NL_095	38	"""But you can expect problems there too next week."
NL_095	39	China's factories have increasingly moved inland in recent years because wages are still low there.
NL_095	40	But much of domestic transportation is also down.
NL_095	41	"So it remains to be seen whether the ships can even be loaded."""
NL_095	42	Moreover, ships take six weeks to travel to Europe.
NL_095	43	So even when factories start running again, goods arrive with delays.
NL_095	44	"""We are already getting customers on the line who want to reserve space on the train for when the factories reopen,"" Groot Wassink says."
NL_095	45	Trains only take 15 days to travel.
NL_095	46	These transport parts for car manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Volvo, BMW, but also for Dutch manufacturers of diesel engines, for example.
NL_095	47	How big the impact is really going to be is still hard to estimate.
NL_095	48	"""Global logistics is so complicated."
NL_095	49	"Sometimes consequences don't become apparent until months later,"" De Jong said."
NL_095	50	"""A few years ago, for example, there was a flood in Thailand that caused factories to close."
NL_095	51	"Months later, this made memory cards at Media Markt more expensive because there were shortages."""
NL_099	1	Spain may send fence climbers back collectively and quickly
NL_099	2	The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Spain did not violate human rights by immediately sending two people who had climbed the fence at the Spanish exclave of Melilla back to Morocco without giving them the opportunity to seek asylum.
NL_099	3	The ruling strengthens proponents of a hard line against illegal immigration in Europe. 1 What was this case about?
NL_099	4	On Aug. 13, 2014, a group of about five hundred people tried to climb over the first of three fences Spain has built around its exclave of Melilla, in Morocco.
NL_099	5	Eventually, about 75 reached the third, inner fence.
NL_099	6	Most of them stayed there for several hours, at six meters high, until the Spanish guardia civil helped them come down in the afternoon.
NL_099	7	Thereupon, they were immediately handcuffed and handed back to Moroccan authorities along with the others, totaling about seventy people.
NL_099	8	Among them were two men from Mali and Ivory Coast, referred to as N.D. and N.T.
NL_099	9	With legal support from ECCHR (European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights), they took the case to the European Court of Human Rights.
NL_099	10	They argued that this collective and immediate expulsion violated their rights to apply for asylum as individuals.
NL_099	11	In October 2017, a Court Chamber ruled in their favor.
NL_099	12	Article 4 of Protocol 4 to the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits collective expulsion.
NL_099	13	Spain appealed.
NL_099	14	The Grand Chamber of seventeen judges ruled Thursday.
NL_099	15	2 Spain got it right.
NL_099	16	How did the court reason?
NL_099	17	In short: own fault.
NL_099	18	"""The lack of an individualized procedure for their deportation resulted from the conduct of the complainants,"" the ruling said ."
NL_099	19	"They broke the law by trying to enter Spanish territory ""with a large group and in a place for which no permission had been given,"" ""taking advantage of the large numbers of the group and using violence."
NL_099	20	"They thus chose not to follow the legal procedures that exist to enter Spanish territory legally."""
NL_099	21	"The fact that they were deported as a group, without considering on an individual basis whether this was justified, ""is therefore a consequence of their behavior,"" the court said."
NL_099	22	3 Does this ruling have implications for other countries?
NL_099	23	Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria and Slovenia have also built fences to stop illegal immigration.
NL_099	24	These countries could use the ruling as justification for swift and collective expulsion in similar cases.
NL_099	25	The Grand Chamber i s the highest body of the human rights court .
NL_099	26	This ruling is not subject to appeal.
NL_099	27	4
NL_099	28	How did relief organizations respond?
NL_099	29	"The ruling ""will be seen as a licence for violent pushback everywhere in Europe,"" Wolfgang Kaleck, general secretary of the ECCHR, said in a statement on the site."
NL_099	30	"The court ""ignores all rights of refugees and migrants."
NL_099	31	"The decision completely ignores the realities at Europe's borders."""
NL_099	32	He and other aid organizations point out that in practice it is extremely difficult to deal with the legal route and apply for asylum at a Spanish consulate in one of the African countries.
NL_099	33	Kaleck points out that for years in Melilla and Ceuta - its other exclave along the Moroccan coast - Spain has been sending back people who climb the fences immediately.
NL_099	34	Gonzalo Boye, lawyer for the two at the Strasbourg court, said in a statement:
NL_099	35	"the court ""not only accepts the Spanish concept of a lawless border zone, but adds a new doctrine that can be applied to any case."
NL_099	36	"those who place themselves in an illegal situation are not protected by the rights recognized in the convention"" for human rights."
NL_099	37	5 Where are the two complainants now?
NL_099	38	The Spanish newspaper El Pais figured it out.
NL_099	39	N.T. from Ivory Coast tried again in Melilla, which he succeeded in doing on Oct. 23, 2014.
NL_099	40	He gave an identity at the time, but it could not be confirmed.
NL_099	41	After two weeks, a deportation order was issued, which N.T. appealed.
NL_099	42	When that was finally rejected, he proved untraceable.
NL_099	43	According to lawyers, he is living in a Schengen country, without a residence permit.
NL_099	44	N.D. from Mali also later managed to enter Melilla - on Dec. 9, 2014.
NL_099	45	He entered an asylum procedure, but his application was rejected.
NL_099	46	He was brought back to Mali, where he now lives.

NL_100	4	"""There is still doubt now."
NL_100	5	"Suppose as a retailer you voluntarily close, can you take advantage of that?"""
NL_100	6	When that clarity is finally there, retail will close.
NL_100	7	"""When that is clear, a lot of businesses will close."
NL_100	8	"Retail will then close en masse."""
NL_100	9	Store chains.
NL_100	10	Already one retail chain after another is closing.
NL_100	11	Home furnishing store Ikea had already closed.
NL_100	12	Joining them now are C&A, Bijenkorf, WE Fashion and Suitsupply, among others.
NL_100	13	Underwear chain Victoria's Secret, makeup store chain Ulta and personal care brands Kiehl's and The Body Shop are also closing for the time being.
NL_100	14	H&M stores will follow suit by Thursday afternoon.
NL_100	15	DAF had already stopped truck production and VDL Nedcar in Born announced Wednesday that no more work will be done there for the next month.
NL_100	16	In other European countries, most of Volkswagen's plants are closing, as are those of PSA, Fiat Chrysler, Renault, Mercedes, Ford and Michelin.
NL_100	17	The corona crisis has created shortages of parts.
NL_100	18	"""It is going much faster than I had thought,"" said Leendert-Jan Visser, director of MKB-Nederland."
NL_100	19	"""Around the country, there are many initiatives by retailers' associations that talk about closing."
NL_100	20	"The consideration is: better to close than to stay open for a few euros in the till."""
NL_100	21	The drop in sales is huge.
NL_100	22	According to a sample just conducted by INretail, 6 in 10 retailers are counting on a 60 to 100 percent drop in sales.
NL_100	23	Certainty.
NL_100	24	Visser understands that some business owners are uncertain about the cabinet measures.
NL_100	25	"""I have no uncertainty whatsoever about the political will to settle this smoothly and properly."
NL_100	26	"But I also dare not put my hands in the fire for the exact execution."""
NL_100	27	"His advice: ""Ensure certainty up front."
NL_100	28	"Check with the UWV first to see if you can use the scheme as well."""
NL_100	29	Some industries are still doing well.
NL_100	30	Meerman lists them: supermarkets, drugstores, garden stores, do-it-yourself stores.
NL_100	31	But even if sales are still good, there may be reason to close the doors.
NL_100	32	"""The first argument in closing is safety of employees and customers."
NL_100	33	Increasingly, employees are questioning whether continuing to work is still responsible.
NL_100	34	Of course everyone wants to keep 1.5 meters away.
NL_100	35	But that how when an optician wants to fit you with new glasses?
NL_100	36	How should that be done in a bridal store?

NL_104	1	Corona crisis Two districts in Germany with many corona infections go into lockdown again
NL_104	2	Update di 23 Jun 16:28
NL_104	3	In Germany, a local lockdown is being implemented for the first time since corona measures were relaxed.
NL_104	4	The Landkreis Gütersloh, a district with some 360,000 inhabitants in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, will go on lockdown until June 30.
NL_104	5	At issue is the area where the Tönnies meat plant is located, which has proven to be a source of contamination.
NL_104	6	A total of more than 1,500 infections have now been recorded there.
NL_104	7	The Landkreis Warendorf, the district of 200,000 inhabitants bordering Kreis Gütersloh, is also going into lockdown.
NL_104	8	Cinemas, cafes and gyms are closing, but going to restaurants is still allowed, albeit only with members of the same household.
NL_104	9	Schools and nurseries were already closed in Gütersloh.
NL_104	10	In Warendorf, that will be the case starting Thursday.
NL_104	11	The neighborhoods around the Tönnies meat factory, where many employees -often foreign workers- live, had previously been quarantined.
NL_104	12	Police are deployed there to monitor compliance with the quarantine.
NL_104	13	The local lockdown in Gütersloh and Warendorf is seen as a preventive measure, designed to prevent the coronavirus from spreading beyond the group of workers and their families.
NL_104	14	Currently, there are 1,500 infections in the area, but only about 25 are not linked to the meat processing plant.
NL_104	15	Our reporter Marijn Trio is in Germany.
NL_104	16	"Watch his analysis in ""The News"" below (continue reading below the video):"
NL_104	17	Also at another slaughterhouse, in Wildeshausen in the state of Lower Saxony, 32 workers tested positive for the coronavirus.
NL_104	18	The company's more than 1,000 employees are now being tested.
NL_104	19	Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institut that monitors corona rates in Germany, said further investigation is needed as to why precisely slaughterhouses and meat plants are proving to be sources of infection.
NL_104	20	This is the case not only in Germany, but also elsewhere, for example in the US.
NL_104	21	The cramped living conditions of foreign workers working in the meat industry certainly contribute to the rapid spread of the virus, Wieler said.
NL_104	22	But the low temperatures in which work is done would also be ideal for the virus to survive for a long time.
NL_104	23	The Robert Koch Institut also announced that the so-called R value or reproduction value of the coronavirus remains high in Germany for the time being.
NL_104	24	It is at 2.76, slightly lower than Sunday's 2.88.
NL_104	25	That means one person infects an average of 2.76 others.
NL_104	26	That R value says something about how fast the coronavirus spreads.
NL_104	27	If no action is taken, the virus spreads with an R value of 3.
NL_104	28	Each person transfers the virus to 3 other persons and so it goes around.
NL_104	29	But it already becomes dangerous when the R-value rises above 1.
NL_104	30	The high R-value is due to localized flare-ups, such as the one at the meat plant in North Rhine-Westphalia, which the government now hopes to curb with a local lockdown.
NL_104	31	"""A second wave is possible in Germany, but we are optimistic that it can be avoided,"" said Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute."

NL_115	1	Dumoulin advises Dutch fans against coming to Tour start
NL_115	2	The Tour de France begins Saturday in an area (Alpes-Maritimes) that has been under the strictest travel advisory (code red) since Thursday due to the increasing number of corona infections.
NL_115	3	"Tom Dumoulin is confident in the ""Tour bubble"" of organizer ASO, but the fans along the roadside are an uncertain factor."
NL_115	4	An hour after Dumoulin addressed an auditorium of cycling journalists via video link from Jumbo-Visma's hotel, French Prime Minister Jean Castex tells a press conference that code red is in effect in 19 additional departments. code red Nice, the city where the Tour circus has gathered for the postponed start of the biggest cycling race of the year, is in the middle of a zone designated by the French government as a hotbed of the coronavirus.
NL_115	5	"""Things are not looking good right now with the corona infections in Nice and other areas of France,"" Dumoulin said."
NL_115	6	"""For the fans, that will have a lot of implications."
NL_115	7	"It will not be a Tour with the summer feeling we are used to."""
NL_115	8	Earlier this week, Dutch authorities already tightened the travel advisory for Nice to orange (essential travel only).
NL_115	9	That means Dutch cycling fans will have to spend 10 days in home quarantine upon their return if they attend the Tour start.
NL_115	10	"""It is not advisable for a Dutch fan to come here,"" Dumoulin said."
NL_115	11	"""That's very annoying, but it is what it is."
NL_115	12	"As riders, we are happy to be able to race again and we are going to try to make the best of it."""
NL_115	13	In recent months, the ASO has established a comprehensive and very strict protocol to ensure that the Tour does go on.
NL_115	14	Everything is designed to keep the riders and accompanying staff in a bubble and out of contact with others.
NL_115	15	Therefore, there are advance digital press conferences, no fans or journalists are allowed near the hotels or the team buses, and interviews will be held only with mouthpiece and at 1.5 meters distance.
NL_115	16	The Tour organizer already tested the measures in recent weeks in the smaller stage races Tour de l'Ain and Critérium du Dauphiné.
NL_115	17	"""And there it was super well organized in the hotel and at the start and finish,"" said Dumoulin, who competed in both races."
NL_115	18	"""I didn't feel unsafe for a moment because of the coronavirus,"" he said."
NL_115	19	Still, the Limburger did see one potential problem in the Tour de l'Ain and the Dauphiné: there were still quite a few fans on the side of the road, and by no means all of them were wearing mouthguards.
NL_115	20	"""Especially on the climbs, about half of the fans did not have a mouthpiece,"" Dumoulin said."
NL_115	21	"""And fans naturally get excited and start screaming and yelling when we come by."
NL_115	22	Normally we like that a lot, but now you run the risk of spreading germs in the peloton.
NL_115	23	"So I hope that will be better regulated at the Tour."""
NL_115	24	"""It's a tricky situation, you can never create 100 percent safety, but my message to fans is: always wear a mask when you come to the Tour."
NL_115	25	"That should be mandatory."""
NL_117	1	Four largest banks halve number of ATMs
NL_117	2	Batopin, the partnership set up by Belgium's four major banks to roll out neutral ATMs, has installed the first six devices.
NL_117	3	The new cash points will progressively replace half of the approximately 5,000 ATMs operated by BNP Paribas, KBC, Belfius and ING until the end of 2024.
NL_117	4	The explanation for the halving refers to the increasing use of electronic means of payment, resulting in a decrease in the use of cash year after year.
NL_117	5	In addition, stocking and securing ATMs costs handsomely.
NL_117	6	By working together as major banks, Batopin says it strives to ensure even distribution throughout Belgium.
NL_117	7	"""Fewer vending machines, but more reach through better distribution,"" describes Batopin CEO Kris De Ryck."
NL_117	8	'Vulnerable locations' Batopin has already identified 150 locations where a pickup point should be located.
NL_117	9	Based on a National Bank study, it was also decided to install 24 additional cash points in vulnerable locations, the company said.
NL_117	10	These are mainly sites in Wallonia, but also some in Flanders (Bekkevoort, Heers, Kieldrecht, Voeren and Wortegem-Petegem).
NL_117	11	'Easy access to cash for every Belgian citizen remains an important fact for the proper functioning of our society, even in times when the number of cash transactions is in decline.
NL_117	12	The National Bank is therefore closely watching the evolution of ATM networks'.
NL_117	13	After the rollout of Batopin, 98.79 percent of the Belgian population should have an ATM within five kilometers of their homes.
NL_117	14	'Accessible' Tuesday there was still criticism from consumer organization Test Aankoop.
NL_117	15	The latter called for a moratorium on the phaseout and wants the government to get involved, to avoid a lack of cash pickup points in the future.
NL_117	16	Batopin notes that it does take into account Test Purchase's proposed criteria, such as accessibility by public transportation or population density.
NL_117	17	When designing the new Bancontact ATMs, great attention was also paid to accessibility for persons with reduced mobility, the blind and visually impaired.
NL_117	18	Very high security standards also apply: the devices are built in with a robust safe, there is camera surveillance and a telephone help desk.
NL_117	19	A special protection of the keyboard is also built in, preventing other people from looking over the shoulder.
NL_117	20	'Bancontact' At the bank-neutral machines, one can withdraw money with any bank card (Bancontact, Mastercard or Visa) and change their PIN, Batopin promises.
NL_117	21	Starting in 2022, merchants - customers of at least one of the major banks - will also be able to deposit money at two-thirds of these ATMs.
NL_117	22	'They will have more opportunities than today,' it sounds.
NL_117	23	The first six pickup points can be found in Anderlecht, Ghent, Lierneux, Stavelot, Nimy and Clavier.
NL_117	24	"The new name of these bank-neutral ATMs sounds surprisingly familiar: ""Bancontact."
NL_117	25	"""This choice of name is not accidental,"" Batopin CEO Kris De Ryck said Wednesday."
NL_117	26	"""Every Belgian knows and trusts Bancontact, a strong brand with decades of roots in our country."
NL_117	27	The smaller banks in Belgium (Crelan, AXA Bank, Argenta Group, vdk bank and bpost) have also already joined forces to manage their ATMs.
NL_124	1	New bank-neutral ATMs to be christened Bancontact
NL_124	2	"""This choice of name is not accidental,"" Batopin CEO Kris De Ryck said Wednesday."
NL_124	3	"""Every Belgian knows and trusts Bancontact, a strong brand with decades of roots in our country."
NL_124	4	It is important that citizens have confidence in the new concept of bank-neutral ATMs.
NL_124	5	"Moreover, ""withdraw money from Bancontact"" is still in the vernacular."
NL_124	6	"So an obvious and logical choice."""
NL_124	7	In 1979, three banks created the Bancontact system: from now on, Belgians could take money out of the wall with their bank card.
NL_124	8	Ten years later came a merger with rival system Mister Cash.
NL_124	9	From then on, people spoke of Bancontact/Mister Cash ATMs.
NL_124	10	The current cooperation between the major banks thus harkens back to the past, when all ATMs in the exterior facades of banks were owned by the banking umbrella Banksys.
NL_124	11	Only many years later were these ATMs transferred to the individual banks.
NL_124	12	The new cash points will gradually replace the ATMs of the major banks (BNP Paribas, KBC, Belfius and ING) until the end of 2024.
NL_124	13	The increasing use of electronic means of payment, which reduces the use of cash year after year, is cited as an explanation.
NL_124	14	In addition, stocking and securing ATMs costs handsomely.
NL_124	15	By working together as major banks, the aim is to ensure even distribution throughout Belgium, Batopin said.

NL_124	25	After the advent of Batopin, 98.79 percent of the Belgian population should have an ATM within five kilometers of their homes.
NL_124	26	Special security.
NL_124	27	At the bank-neutral ATMs, one can withdraw money with any bank card (Bancontact, Mastercard or Visa) and change his PIN, Batopin promises.

NL_127	8	The Nikkei in Tokyo ended 0.4 percent down.
NL_127	9	The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down 1.5 percent in the interim on sharp price losses at major Chinese Internet companies such as Alibaba and Tencent.
NL_127	10	Wall Street managed to erase losses Monday night after gloom over Chinese growth.
NL_127	11	In the process, the Dow and the S&P sharpened their peaks again.
NL_127	12	Rein Schutte, investment advisor at Noesis Capital Management, emphasizes that record chasing continues unabated, especially in America.
NL_127	13	He points out that this afternoon's US detail sales are important for sentiment.
NL_127	14	"""Despite the sharp decline in US consumer confidence, this trend is not expected to be reflected in retail sales partly because government assistance programs continue to provide support."""
NL_127	15	Although the advance in the AEX has briefly halted, Schutte does not assume that a larger correction is in the offing.
NL_127	16	"""Certainly as long as shares of the heavyweight index fund ASML remain on the upside, there is support below the AEX."
NL_127	17	Further, with the end of the numbers season in sight, the focus will increasingly be on the meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole later this month.
NL_127	18	"The expectation there is that there will be more clarity on the agenda for unwinding monetary stimulus in the US."""
NL_127	19	Prosus in rear.
NL_127	20	In the AEX, Prosus (-2.7%) is again weighed down by the sell-off in Chinese tech giants and Tencent in particular, in which the tech investor has a large stake.
NL_127	21	Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield is also in the rear with a loss of 1.5%.
NL_127	22	ING is looking at a 0.5% loss.
NL_127	23	It is the favorite bank in the Benelux at Morgan Stanley.

NL_127	27	The meal delivery company invested heavily in the past reporting period after acquiring Britain's Just Eat.
NL_127	28	The incorporation of US-based Grubhub also contributed to the hefty loss.
NL_127	29	The group's sales did rise sharply and the company expects the trough of losses to have already passed.
NL_127	30	According to Schutte, Just Eat Takeaway is mainly waiting to see how the next six months will go.

NL_130	1	Court of Auditors annual report: risk of fraud in EU budget grows The European Court of Auditors this Thursday gave an adverse opinion on the previous year's EU spending for the third year in a row.
NL_130	2	The number of errors in the disbursement of EU funds is increasing, indicating growing risks to the European budget.
NL_130	3	In its annual report this Thursday, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) gave an adverse opinion on the previous year's EU spending for the third consecutive year.
NL_130	4	Worryingly, according to the ERK, in addition, the criteria for disbursements from the large-scale corona recovery fund are not defined clearly enough for proper testing.
NL_130	5	More suspected fraud.
NL_130	6	The share of errors in spending from the EU budget rose to 3 percent in 2021 from 2.7 percent a year earlier.
NL_130	7	"""That is really worrying,"" said Stef Blok, ex-minister for the VVD and since this spring a Dutch member of the European Court of Auditors."
NL_130	8	"""This is public money and this error rate is substantial."""
NL_130	9	If the Court detects an error, it does not automatically mean fraud or waste: it just means that pre-formulated rules for disbursement were not (fully) followed.
NL_130	10	However, auditors did identify a greater number of cases of suspected fraud this year: 15 compared to six a year earlier.
NL_130	11	The suspicions were passed on to the European anti-fraud office OLAF and the newly created European Public Prosecutor's Office.
NL_130	12	"While the number of fraud cases is small, the ECA is concerned that a growing share of the EU budget is made up of ""high-risk"" spending: spending where accountability is ex post, and linked to complex conditions."
NL_130	13	These include, for example, the development of disadvantaged European regions, development aid or major research projects.
NL_130	14	"""The risk of fraud is increasing,"" said ERK President Tony Murphy."
NL_130	15	Clear criteria.
NL_130	16	Unlike, for example, agricultural funds or scholarships, with clear rules that a beneficiary must meet before disbursement, for high-risk expenditures, accountability takes place after the fact.
NL_130	17	In 2014, the share of such spending was 47 percent, while last year it was already 63 percent of the EU budget.
NL_130	18	"""It is ultimately a political decision what European programs come about,"" Blok said."
NL_130	19	"""But our commitment will always be: apply clear criteria, make them easily verifiable and make it clear to the public, the press and to us how expenditures are tested."""
NL_130	20	That clarity is lacking, according to the ECA, with the new corona recovery fund, from which hundreds of billions in subsidies will flow to member states.
NL_130	21	Disbursements from that fund have only recently come on stream, and for 2021, the Court could only test one payment, of 11.5 billion to Spain.
NL_130	22	Although no illegalities were found in that payment, the auditor is concerned that the criteria for disbursement are difficult to test.
NL_130	23	For expenditures from the normal EU budget, receipts and invoices can be checked for accuracy and compliance with certain financing conditions.
NL_130	24	"But prior to a disbursement from the recovery fund, a member state must come up with a ""milestone"": generally introducing certain legislation or implementing a reform."
NL_130	25	According to the Court, the Commission does not make sufficiently clear how it tests the achievement of such a milestone.
NL_130	26	"""We have been waiting for a clear methodology from the Commission for some time,"" Murphy said."
NL_130	27	"""For this year, we expect seventeen disbursements from the recovery fund that we want to test, so time is running out."""
NL_130	28	"Blok also called it ""very urgent"" that clear criteria be established quickly."
NL_132	1	Hungarian Prime Minister Orban:
NL_132	2	"""European sanctions are a step toward war"""
NL_132	3	"""We supply destructive weapons, we train Ukrainian soldiers on our territory, we impose energy sanctions."
NL_132	4	"We are becoming an integral part"" of the conflict, Orban said Friday on the national radio station."
NL_132	5	"""People are not shooting us yet, but we are on the verge of becoming a belligerent."
NL_132	6	"Europe is playing a very dangerous game""."
NL_132	7	Orban draws particular criticism for the sanctions against Russia, which he blames for Hungary's economic hardship.
NL_132	8	The Hungarian economy contracted in the third quarter (compared to the second quarter), with inflation exceeding 20 percent, and as high as 45 percent for food.
NL_132	9	Campaign.
NL_132	10	The introduction of sanctions requires unanimity among member states.
NL_132	11	"Although Hungary has not stopped any package of sanctions so far, Orban's nationalist government launched a popular poll and poster campaign at home with a picture of a bomb and the message, ""The sanctions are ruining us."""
NL_132	12	"Orban therefore promised to ""fight"" any new package of sanctions and ensure that Hungary is ""exempted,"" as is already the case with the embargo on Russian oil imports."
NL_132	13	Hungary is particularly dependent on Russian fossil fuels.
NL_132	14	Aid to Ukraine.
NL_132	15	Orban also opposes the proposal to offer Ukraine up to 18 billion euros in soft loans next year to keep the state apparatus running in times of war.
NL_132	16	The member states would pay the interest.
NL_132	17	"""Hungary is not going to accept that member states take out loans together to help Ukraine,"" he said at a conference, quoted by news agency MTI."
NL_132	18	"Budapest prefers the disbursement of an amount ""fairly"" distributed among member states."
NL_132	19	For example, Hungary could provide up to 170 million euros under a bilateral agreement with Kiev, the head of government said.
NL_132	20	European Commission: 'Counting on support from all member states' In a response, a European Commission spokeswoman recalled Friday that the proposal was worked out on the basis of a request from the European Council, which includes Orban.
NL_132	21	"""Given the urgency, the Commission expects to count on the support of all member states for this much-needed package."
NL_132	22	"The EU is most effective when it acts in unison,"" the spokeswoman stated."
NL_132	23	It does refuse to see a connection between Hungarian opposition to loans to Ukraine and the blocking of European subsidies to Budapest because of rule of law problems.
NL_132	24	"""The EU is based on law, and decisions on the allocation of funds to Hungary will be made within the framework of the rules governing these funds, and not based on external affairs,"" a spokesman said."
NL_137	1	European Commission launches proceedings against United Kingdom for breaches of Brexit deal:
NL_137	2	"""Violating international agreements is not acceptable"""
NL_137	3	The protocol is part of the Brexit deal agreed between the European Union and the UK in early 2020.
NL_137	4	It regulates the special status of Northern Ireland after the Brexit.
NL_137	5	The British province may no longer belong to the EU, but it is still part of the European single market and customs union.
NL_137	6	That arrangement is supposed to keep the peace in Northern Ireland, but because of practical problems, it is causing a great deal of discontent both in the province itself and in Britain.
NL_137	7	On Monday night, the British government filed its long-awaited bill to unilaterally disregard the protocol.
NL_137	8	According to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that draft is primarily intended to unblock the political impasse in Northern Ireland.
NL_137	9	Indeed, the unionist DUP refuses to join the government there until the trade agreements are reviewed.
NL_137	10	London therefore proposes separate arrangements for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the one hand, and for trade between Great Britain and (EU member state) Ireland on the other.
NL_137	11	The measure is full.
NL_137	12	For the Commission, however, the measure is full.
NL_137	13	For London to still refuse to properly implement the protocol after more than two years amounts to a violation of international law.
NL_137	14	Indeed, the Brexit agreement has the status of a treaty.
NL_137	15	Specifically, the Commission accuses the UK of not carrying out the necessary sanitary and phytosanitary checks on food, plants and animals brought into Northern Ireland.
NL_137	16	London also provides the EU with too little data on trade with Belfast.
NL_137	17	The British government now has two months to respond to these two new infringement proceedings.
NL_137	18	The third procedure was already launched in March 2021, but is now being taken to its next stage.
NL_137	19	This infringement case also relates to food trade.
NL_137	20	This case threatens a referral to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in two months.
NL_137	21	With its bill, moreover, the Johnson administration is seeking to just undercut the Court's jurisdiction to settle disputes in the context of the Protocol.
NL_137	22	"""Violating international agreements is not acceptable"" It is European Commissioner Maros Sefcovic who announced the new legal proceedings Wednesday."
NL_137	23	"""Trust is gained by fulfilling international commitments,"" he said."
NL_137	24	"""Acting unilaterally is not constructive."
NL_137	25	"Violating international agreements is not acceptable."""
NL_137	26	Sefcovic reiterates that only through negotiations within the framework of the protocol can solutions be found to the problems of trade to and from Northern Ireland.
NL_137	27	"""I remain convinced that we can achieve our goals with genuine political will to make the protocol succeed."""
NL_137	28	He asks London to take a closer look at the possible solutions he puts forward.
NL_137	29	"""Only with mutually supported solutions will we create the legal certainty that the people and businesses in Northern Ireland deserve."""
NL_137	30	Breaking open the entire protocol is unrealistic, according to the Commission.
NL_137	31	During years of negotiations, no workable alternative was found to what was finally put on paper regarding Northern Ireland.
NL_137	32	A renegotiation would create precisely more uncertainty, the Berlaymont reads.
NL_138	1	Aviation How 'green' is an airplane?
NL_138	2	"According to Brussels, maybe quite green If Europe puts planes on the list of sustainable investments, the majority of planes under construction will get a ""green"" label."
NL_138	3	"Can an airplane be a ""green"" investment?"
NL_138	4	Feeling-wise, most people will probably say no.
NL_138	5	Yet the answer to this question is not at all clear in Brussels.
NL_138	6	Opinions within the European Commission are divided on this issue, according to Reuters news agency .
NL_138	7	"And according to proposals now on the table from a special advisory board of the European Commission, aircraft could indeed be labeled ""green"" in some cases."
NL_138	8	In fact, the majority of the aircraft to be built: 90 percent of the planes Airbus now has on order would qualify, environmental organization Transport & Environment (T&E) said Friday based on its own calculations.
NL_138	9	"These planes from Airbus, the world's largest aircraft maker, may be slightly less polluting than older models, but they still fly ""almost exclusively"" on fossil fuels, according to T&E."
NL_138	10	Airbus did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
NL_138	11	Aviation is estimated to be responsible for about 2 to 3 percent of global CO 2 emissions 'Clear definition' What counts as green is determined in Europe by the so-called taxonomy , a kind of handbook listing all economic activities that are considered sustainable.
NL_138	12	"Because, Brussels felt, a ""clear definition"" of sustainable was much needed."
NL_138	13	The idea is that the taxonomy will direct more investments to sustainable destinations - helping to meet the Paris climate goals.
NL_138	14	Meanwhile, the taxonomy is partially in place.
NL_138	15	As large investors are increasingly concerned that their investments be green, or at least part of them, companies are also keen to be green.
NL_138	16	If you are not that as a company according to the taxonomy, then you are also less attractive to investors, is the idea.
NL_138	17	Aircraft are not (yet) found in the current taxonomy - airports are, by the way, under the heading ' low carbon airport infrastructure '.
NL_138	18	But taxonomy is not a static thing; it is revised from time to time.
NL_138	19	The Platform on Sustainable Finance, which advises the European Commission on taxonomy, recommended last year that aircraft be included, specifically those that do not emit anything - they do not yet exist - as well as those that are 'best in class'.
NL_138	20	According to Transport & Environment, aircraft quickly fall into that category: if they are slightly more efficient than older generations of aircraft.
NL_138	21	Pure greenwashing, judges T&E.
NL_138	22	The airline industry thinks otherwise: they do deserve a spot on the list, they think.
NL_138	23	To that end, they are making strenuous efforts: aviation lobby groups have sent letters to the Commission this month urging it to do so.
NL_138	24	"Keeping them out of the taxonomy would hamper the industry's ""efforts to decarbonize,"" according to one of the letters seen by Reuters."
NL_138	25	"Airbus also considers it ""essential"" that aircraft enter the taxonomy, the company told the Financial Times Credibility."
NL_138	26	There is still no agreement within the European Commission, Reuters wrote two weeks ago.
NL_138	27	While some Eurocommissioners would be in favor of classifying certain aviation investments as green, others do not want the sector in the taxonomy at all.
NL_138	28	The fear is that the inclusion of aviation further undermines the green content of the document.
NL_138	29	Indeed, the idea was that taxonomy would become a gold standard, an authority that would finally end the debate over what is sustainable.
NL_138	30	But even before it was supposed to go into effect, a lot of criticism came last year against the proposal to include gas and nuclear power for the time being.
NL_138	31	According to the Commission, both are still needed in the energy transition in the near future and therefore deserve a green label under certain conditions.
NL_138	32	But critical member states and also parties in the financial community fear for the taxonomy's credibility.
NL_138	33	Eventually, gas and nuclear power got in, although two lawsuits are still pending to undo this.
NL_138	34	This past history puts the Commission in a difficult position: each addition will be subject to additional scrutiny.
NL_140	1	NU+ | Facebook knows everything about you, but with Chinese apps it gets really scary
NL_140	2	Intelligence agency AIVD counts China among countries with offensive cyber program.
NL_140	3	These states use digital means to spy or direct social debate, for example.
NL_140	4	On the advice of the AIVD, the cabinet decided this week to soon ban apps from these countries altogether on government phones.
NL_140	5	Chinese apps, services and products have long been under a Western magnifying glass.
NL_140	6	For example, the Chinese company Huawei was blacklisted by the US.
NL_140	7	This banned the use of Huawei technology in communications and networking equipment.
NL_140	8	Huawei's 5G chips are also no longer used in the main equipment of telecom companies in the Netherlands.
NL_140	9	"""The US wants to prevent China from becoming an equal competitor,"" said China expert Frans-Paul van der Putten of Clingendael Research Institute."
NL_140	10	The Asian country is growing rapidly in terms of economy, technology and as a military power.
NL_140	11	The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) recently examined which countries are at the forefront of 44 key technologies.
NL_140	12	They include artificial intelligence, space, energy and biotechnology.
NL_140	13	The survey shows that China is the market leader in 37 of those categories.
NL_140	14	So concerns that China is becoming extremely powerful technologically are not out of the blue.
NL_140	15	"""Western governments increasingly see China as a threat and Chinese technology therefore,"" said Van der Putten of Clingendael."
NL_140	16	"""That's why we are anticipating now."
NL_140	17	"Do we want to get started on technology that may later prove dangerous?"""
NL_140	18	The concern is based on something, agrees Paul Verhagen, a researcher at The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies (HCSS).
NL_140	19	"""The fear sometimes takes on somewhat paranoid forms."
NL_140	20	"Just look at how the West reacted when a Chinese balloon hovered over the US recently."""
NL_140	21	The Netherlands is an ally of the United States.
NL_140	22	"""If the U.S. sees China as a major threat, then we have to move with it,"" Van der Putten said."
NL_140	23	But there are also indications that allies are spying on each other.
NL_140	24	Whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the U.S. intelligence agency NSA was intercepting communications traffic worldwide on a massive scale.
NL_140	25	The Netherlands was also bugged for years.
NL_140	26	In 2020, it became clear that the NSA was using Danish Internet cables to eavesdrop on top politicians from countries such as Germany, France and Sweden.
NL_140	27	This news caused some commotion, but did not lead to bans on U.S. services.
NL_140	28	Facebook, for example, is allowed on government phones in Europe, despite all the negative coverage surrounding that company.
NL_140	29	In 2018, for example, it was revealed that information of 87 million Facebook users had been exposed on the street.
NL_140	30	That data was later used by Donald Trump's campaign team to run targeted ads ahead of the U.S. presidential election.
NL_140	31	Meanwhile, it is no secret that spying is taking place in Europe on behalf of the Chinese state, knows Dave Maasland of cybersecurity firm ESET Netherlands.
NL_140	32	In any case, the cabinet's new policy is clear.
NL_140	33	"""Apps from countries that we know are attacking us, we don't want them on government phones."""
NL_140	34	So that goes beyond just TikTok.
NL_140	35	Other Chinese apps will also soon be unwelcome on central government work phones.
NL_140	36	In this regard, it does not matter whether it is just a fun app or one that is out for your data.
NL_140	37	"""You can think of it this way,"" Maasland explained."
NL_140	38	"""If you have an argument with your neighbor, you won't borrow sugar from the neighbor either."
NL_140	39	"Because you think: I don't quite trust what happens there at home anyway."""
NL_152	1	De Wever wants federal contingency plan
NL_152	2	'However, the federal government has sole authority to coordinate a national health issue.
NL_152	3	With yesterday's communication, advising local governments without further official information to take immediate coercive measures for certain gatherings on their territory, the federal government itself has organized chaos.
NL_152	4	The divergent decisions in several cities prove, according to De Wever, that there are multiple interpretations of the opinion.
NL_152	5	To minimize the spread of the coronavirus and protect vulnerable residents, the Brussels Region has decided to ban all non-essential visits in residential services, including rest homes.
NL_152	6	This was announced Wednesday by the cabinet of Brussels Minister Alain Maron (Ecolo).
NL_152	7	The restrictions are in place until the end of March, but may be extended depending on future developments.
NL_152	8	A cruise ship is currently not allowed to dock in Zeebrugge because two passengers may have been infected with the corona virus.
NL_152	9	So says West Flanders governor Carl Decaluwé (CD&V).
NL_152	10	Two passengers reportedly had contact with an infected German.
NL_152	11	'The doctor on board must now judge whether it is safe to let the passengers go ashore,' the governor said.
NL_152	12	Until then, the ship will not be allowed to dock in the port of Zeebrugge.
NL_152	13	It is not yet clear from where exactly the cruise ship came.
NL_152	14	Organizers who allow events with more than 1,000 attendees to go ahead anyway, despite the federal government's advice not to allow large indoor activities, may be held liable if they do not behave as a prudent organization.
NL_152	15	So says Wauthier Robyns, spokesman for Assuralia, the insurance industry federation.
NL_152	16	He considers it unlikely that organizations have included in their cancellation insurance an epidemic such as the coronavirus.
NL_152	17	If someone becomes infected at an event that still goes on, the insurer must determine whether or not the organizer was careful, Robyns explains.
NL_152	18	Whether the organizer can rely on his liability insurance depends on the exclusions in the insurance policy.
NL_152	19	Robyns also points out that there are gradations between running an accepted risk and full liability.
NL_152	20	For example, it can be questioned why someone attends an event if the government advises canceling it.
NL_152	21	In Antwerp, 46 events with 1,000 to 40,000 attendees are programmed over the next two weeks, spread across eight municipalities, Berx stated.
NL_152	22	She will turn the recommendation into regulations Wednesday.
NL_152	23	Consultation with mayors and the hospital sector will follow afterwards.
NL_152	24	Most importantly, the goal is achieved.
NL_152	25	'We have to avoid flooding hospitals due to the meteoric spread of the virus,' Berx said.
NL_152	26	Doctors are normally allowed to give a doctor's bill only after a physical examination.
NL_152	27	In special situations, family physicians may conduct teleconsultations, in which the patient tells his or her story over the phone.
NL_152	28	"""Minimizing the movement of infected patients or those suspected of being infected with the virus is a priority measure in the health response to this pandemic,"" the Order wrote in an advisory."
NL_152	29	The Order does impose minimum requirements for remote contact.
NL_152	30	The physician must know the patient and his history well, have access to the medical record and be able to ensure continuity of care.
NL_152	31	A physician contacted by telephone must always weigh the risks to the patient and to the community.
NL_152	32	Physicians can deliver the certificate to the patient via mail or digital means.
NL_152	33	The physician must note in the patient's record that he provided a certificate after telephone contact.
NL_152	34	"""We've been pushing for that for two days,"" said Roel Van Giel of the Domus Medica GP organization."
NL_152	35	'It's really necessary, anticipating next steps.'
NL_152	36	He does not expect much abuse of the relaxation.
NL_152	37	'That's always possible, but I think it will be a very small minority.'

NL_158	3	At least 290 million children worldwide cannot attend school because of the coronavirus.
NL_158	4	In 13 countries, including China, Japan, Iran and Italy, all schools have been closed to prevent the spread of the virus, reports UN organization Unesco .
NL_158	5	The Italian government decided Wednesday to be the first European country to close all schools and universities. until March 15 Spread across three continents, 22 countries have taken measures affecting education.
NL_158	6	Nine governments have closed schools in certain parts of the country, including the United States, Germany and France.
NL_158	7	Because UNESCO does not know how many children are affected, children in these countries do not count toward the 290 million total.
NL_158	8	The organization does argue that another 180 million children will not be able to attend school if all schools are closed in these countries as well.
NL_158	9	If schools remain closed longer, the right to education could be jeopardized, argues Unesco director Audrey Azoulay.
NL_158	10	"""While temporary school closures due to public health are not new, the global scale and speed of disruption to education is unprecedented."""

NL_161	1	Rotterdam prey to 'an orgy of violence'
NL_161	2	Rioting in the center of Rotterdam against corona measures left seven people injured and at least 20 arrests made Friday night.
NL_161	3	Reports of a fatality are circulating on social media, but Rotterdam police cannot confirm that.
NL_161	4	Hundreds of protesters had gathered on Coolsingel in Rotterdam Friday night.
NL_161	5	They were protesting the so-called 2G policy where people are only given coronapas if they are vaccinated or cured.
NL_161	6	The demonstration then turned into riots.
NL_161	7	Rioters set off heavy fireworks, set fires in several places and threw objects at police.
NL_161	8	Seven people were injured in the riots and at least 20 arrests were made.
NL_161	9	Reports of a fatality are circulating on social media, but Rotterdam police cannot confirm that.
NL_161	10	'We too are hearing rumors that someone would have died in the disturbances,' it sounds on Twitter.
NL_161	11	'Neither with us nor with the National Criminal Investigation Department was there any report of that.'
NL_161	12	Earlier in the day, i.e. Friday, social media had already called for a demonstration against the corona policy.
NL_161	13	A city spokeswoman informed that the demonstration had not been notified.
NL_161	14	"""That it was going to be so intense, we didn't expect it either,"" said a police spokesman."
NL_161	15	"Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb spoke afterwards of ""an orgy of violence"" in the center of Rotterdam."
NL_161	16	"According to the mayor, the police have now ""regained power"" in the heart of the city, where hundreds of people gathered Friday night to protest the so-called 2G policy the government is pushing."
NL_161	17	In doing so, people will only get corona admission when they are vaccinated or cured.
NL_161	18	In the riots that broke out, police fired shots and several people were injured.
NL_161	19	The shots were reportedly warning shots, but targeted shots were also fired, a police spokesman said.
NL_161	20	"""What exactly happened, we are going to investigate,"" said Rotterdam Chief Public Prosecutor Hugo Hillenaar, who added that he expects more arrests."
NL_161	21	Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus also said so on Saturday morning.
NL_161	22	"He called the riots in Rotterdam ""revolting to see."
NL_161	23	The minister also acknowledged that the corona measures are stirring up a lot in society, and it should be possible to have a robust debate about them.
NL_161	24	'Harassment and violence don't belong there.
NL_161	25	Demonstrating is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior.
NL_161	26	Rotterdam woke up Saturday with a hangover, states Alderman Vincent Karremans (outdoor space and enforcement).
NL_161	27	'While Rotterdam wakes up with a hangover from a night that has made a lot of Rotterdammers, including me, very angry, the heroes of Stadsbeheer are already hours away cleaning up the mess so the city can reopen,' Karremans tweeted.

NL_166	1	Limburg Gas plant in Dilsen-Stokkem gets no environmental permit 53 min
NL_166	2	Flemish Environment Minister Zuhal Demir (N-VA) refuses to grant an environmental permit for the construction of a gas power plant in Dilsen-Stokkem in Limburg.
NL_166	3	The amount of nitrogen that the plant would emit poses a threat to surrounding natural areas and in addition, the project also violates some basic rules of land use planning, Minister Demir said.
NL_166	4	Minister Demir's refusal has a history that began late last year.
NL_166	5	Energy company Dils-Energie then applied for a building permit for a gas power plant in Rotem, a borough of Dilsen-Stokkem.
NL_166	6	The gas plant would live 920 megawatts of power, good for supplying nearly 1 million households.
NL_166	7	During the public inquiry that followed the application, more than 1,000 neighbors of the site where the plant would be located filed objections.
NL_166	8	The city council of Dilsen-Stokkem joined the objections, issuing a negative opinion.
NL_166	9	The city council and local residents judged that the size of the plant would disrupt the landscape.
NL_166	10	They were also concerned about CO2 and nitrogen emissions.
NL_166	11	The provincial government of Limburg subsequently decided not to grant an environmental permit for the plant.
NL_166	12	Such a permit is a necessary condition for construction to begin.
NL_166	13	But Germany's RWE, Dils-Energie's parent company, appealed the provincial government's decision to authorized Minister Demir.
NL_166	14	The latter in turn has now ruled that the Dilsen-Stokkem gas plant will not receive an environmental permit.
NL_166	15	The motivation for its decision states that the plant is not in compliance with subdivision regulations and is also larger than permitted.
NL_166	16	There would also be too little green space on the site, and because the plant would draw cooling water from the adjacent canal, the minister is also concerned about the potential impact on surrounding natural areas.
NL_166	17	After all, these could dry out.
NL_166	18	What worries Minister Demir most is the amount of nitrogen the gas plant would emit, in the form of ammonia and nitrogen oxide (NOx).
NL_166	19	Annually, the plant would disperse 100,000 pounds of ammonia and 340,000 pounds of NOx, all near protected natural areas.
NL_166	20	The nitrogen could cause plants that thrive on nitrogen-rich soils to displace other plants, threatening to eliminate the original vegetation in natural areas.
NL_166	21	In doing so, Flanders would violate the European Habitats Directive, which says member states must protect the original habitats of plants and animals.
NL_166	22	The minister also points to the amount of CO2 the plant would emit.
NL_166	23	It would be so large that 60,000 hectares of forest would have to be planted to offset the emissions.
NL_166	24	The construction of the Dilsen-Stokkem gas-fired power plant was intended to deal with the possible consequences of the closure of the Doel and Tihange nuclear power plants.
NL_166	25	All seven of these are scheduled to be closed by 2025.
NL_166	26	Estimates suggest that 3 to 4 gas power plants would be needed to make up for the loss of generating capacity.
NL_166	27	One of 8 applicants has already dropped out with the denial of the environmental permit.
NL_166	28	Although RWE can still appeal Minister Demir's decision to the Council for Permit Disputes.

NL_183	18	ABP has 2.4 billion in direct investments in solar and wind power in Europe and the United States.
NL_183	19	Through investments in other companies and funds, the total investment in renewable energy amounts to 18.5 billion euros writes, the company.
NL_183	20	"ABP uses the criteria of the United Nations' ""Sustainable Development Goal 7"" for this purpose."
NL_183	21	Usually a pension fund invests in projects that are operational or under construction but ABP now wants to have an influence even in the development phase, says board chairman Harmen van Wijnen.
NL_183	22	"""It is beneficial for financial returns to be at the beginning and we want a say in how the park is built."
NL_183	23	"We also want to build knowledge and expertise and show that we are a major player in the Dutch energy transition."""
NL_183	24	As the Netherlands and other countries fill much of the North Sea with wind farms, there is more discussion about their impact on nature.
NL_183	25	"Van Wijnen: ""I think it can be done better, we want more consideration for flora and fauna and more attention to the innovation of wind turbines."""
NL_183	26	Among other things, this should prevent migratory birds from crashing into the windmills.
NL_183	27	ABP, through the partnership Noordzeker, wants to compete for the tender for the four lots of the IJmuiden Ver wind farm, 62 kilometers off the Dutch coast, as early as next year.
NL_183	28	The pension fund also wants to influence government licensing requirements for wind farm tenders.
NL_183	29	"Van Wijnen: ""We hope the government will be sensitive to the social value of our participation."
NL_183	30	"We have to invest money for thirty, forty years for our participants and we want to do that in renewable energy projects that are visible to them."""
NL_183	31	The pension fund expects to announce soon which major energy company it wants to partner with to build the wind farms.
NL_183	32	Furthermore, ABP is talking to several knowledge institutes in the Netherlands about new techniques for energy storage, among other things.
NL_183	33	The cabinet has doubled the Dutch climate agreement's ambitions for offshore wind from 11 to over 21 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 to meet Europe's tightened climate targets.
NL_183	34	By 2050, according to the international Paris Climate Agreement, the world must be carbon neutral.
NL_183	35	The Netherlands and neighboring countries want 150 GW of capacity built on the North Sea by then.
NL_183	36	Added to that are the investments of France, the United Kingdom and Norway, making the North Sea a very large power plant.
NL_194	1	Schools out of town (and other radical solutions to the teacher shortage)
NL_194	2	These are some of the headlines (and Internet headlines) in recent weeks about the problems in education.
NL_194	3	That more teachers are needed, many people agree.
NL_194	4	As well as about the fact that such a thing is not settled overnight.
NL_194	5	It raises the question of whether other, more drastic measures are not needed to defuse the crisis.
NL_194	6	We asked education researcher Hans Luyten of the University of Twente, Petra van Haren of the General Association of School Leaders and Professor of Educational Labor Market at the universities of Maastricht and Tilburg Frank Cörvers.
NL_194	7	The problem is greatest in the Randstad .
NL_194	8	It is therefore no coincidence that a school umbrella from the capital will close 16 schools for a week next month in protest.
NL_194	9	There are 25 job openings at the Western Garden Cities Foundation.
NL_194	10	Professor Cörvers attributes this to the fact that life for teachers is too expensive in Amsterdam.
NL_194	11	"""Then why not make those schools near where teachers can live?"""
NL_194	12	Proximity and approachability.
NL_194	13	He advocates moving schools to the outskirts of the city.
NL_194	14	"""People apparently really want to live in Amsterdam and then maybe they have to accept that they have to travel a little longer to take the kids to school."""
NL_194	15	Cörvers also mentions mergers as a possible measure because not all schools are equally short of teachers.
NL_194	16	"""Then you spread the problem a bit across the Netherlands."""
NL_194	17	Van Haren does see one major objection.
NL_194	18	According to the president of the General Association of School Leaders, proximity and approachability are important for an elementary school.
NL_194	19	"""Kids want to play with their friends from school and that's hard when you live far from school."""
NL_194	20	Education researcher Luyten cites adjusting ambitions as an option to relieve the pressure.
NL_194	21	"""New things are often requested from politics."
NL_194	22	When people misbehave, we need to pay attention to citizenship at school.
NL_194	23	If people are getting too fat, we need to pay attention to nutrition in schools.
NL_194	24	"At some point, the system becomes overloaded."""
NL_194	25	A less crowded curriculum leads to less pressure on teachers, Luyten argues.
NL_194	26	Another possibility is more children per teacher .
NL_194	27	This happens regularly already by necessity: classes are merged (temporarily) when a teacher is sick.
NL_194	28	But it could also be structural, although none of the three experts favors it.
NL_194	29	"""It leads to more escalation, worse teaching and ultimately more teacher dropout,"" Cörvers said."
NL_194	30	"""Larger classes you see, for example, in South Korea, Japan, China,"" Luyten states."
NL_194	31	"""You can, but you have to have docile and disciplined children."
NL_194	32	"I don't see that happening one, two, three times with us."""
NL_210	1	Coronavirus Hospitals prepare for exceptionally severe weather More and more hospitals are reporting infection of their own staff.
NL_210	2	Under increasing pressure, measures are being taken.
NL_210	3	Hospital wards are being emptied.
NL_210	4	Non-urgent examinations or surgeries are cancelled, as are outpatient visits without an acute need.
NL_210	5	Regular patients are often allowed only one or two visitors a day - and they must not have flu-like symptoms.
NL_210	6	These are some of the measures hospitals have taken to prepare for what is to come.
NL_210	7	For some hospitals, it is still lull before the storm.
NL_210	8	For some, the wind is already picking up.
NL_210	9	But all are preparing for the exceptionally severe weather that hospitals in Brabant have already found themselves in, according to a brief tour or the information they themselves put on their websites.
NL_210	10	Hospital meetings are canceled.
NL_210	11	Employees have less room to move around.
NL_210	12	They are no longer allowed to go to conferences, teach (or attend) or gather in excessively large groups.
NL_210	13	They are also asked to stop going abroad.
NL_210	14	Some hospitals therefore also allow staff members to work from home as much as possible.
NL_210	15	All to minimize the risk of infection to patients and their own staff.
NL_210	16	The Wilhelmina Hospital in Assen - no infections of staff and patients yet - is therefore also going to put up a tent in front of the hospital.
NL_210	17	There, everyone is checked for symptoms before entering.
NL_210	18	Increasing pressure.
NL_210	19	Preparations change from hour to hour, and under increasing pressure.
NL_210	20	More and more hospitals, meanwhile, are reporting the infection of their own staff.
NL_210	21	Six employees in five different departments at the UMCG in Groningen have corona, the hospital announced Sunday afternoon.
NL_210	22	The Haaglanden Medical Center in The Hague was also affected.
NL_210	23	Two employees were found to have the coronavirus on Friday.
NL_210	24	While they are sitting at home, all employees who had contact with them and have complaints are being tested.
NL_210	25	What is certain, says a hospital spokesman, is that the staff is not talking about the one corona patient admitted there Tuesday.
NL_210	26	Haaglanden is also setting up a nursing unit to accommodate corona patients soon.
NL_210	27	The hospital is noticing more people coming to the emergency room with respiratory complaints.
NL_210	28	These are immediately isolated until it is clear what they have.
NL_210	29	Insulate.
NL_210	30	At the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, with four locations south-east of Rotterdam, one corona patient is in intensive care, a spokesman said.
NL_210	31	Infected employees are not there yet.
NL_210	32	But the hospital has already cleared two wards to combat corona: one for patients who definitely have corona and so can lie together.
NL_210	33	Another to isolate all persons who are potentially infected, and thus all must be isolated separately.
NL_210	34	Amsterdam's OLVG - where two employees now appear to have corona - has freed up a ward for corona patients at both locations.
NL_210	35	Other hospitals do not go as far at this time, such as the UMC in Utrecht or the Rijnstate in Arnhem, for example, which has two corona patients.
NL_210	36	According to the sites of these hospitals, most regular appointments will still go on, except when someone has flu-like symptoms.
NL_210	37	Even at hospitals that are still quiet, scarcity is looming here and there.
NL_210	38	At Albert Schweitzer, for example, this applies to mouth caps.
NL_210	39	Through the Acute Care Regional Consultations, hospitals try to organize the distribution of scarce assets.
NL_210	40	"A spokesperson said, ""The stock of masks is rapidly dwindling."
NL_210	41	We urge hospitals with large supplies to make some of them available to us.
NL_210	42	"We cannot treat patients if we cannot adequately protect our staff."""
NL_212	1	Between war and life
NL_212	2	The eternal war in Iraq:
NL_212	3	four reasons why peace looks impossible 58 min
NL_212	4	Iraq is in a holding pattern.
NL_212	5	The missile attack on a top Iranian general at Baghdad airport drags Iraq into the geopolitical conflict between Iran and the US.
NL_212	6	All this while the country has not even put its house in order internally.
NL_212	7	"""If I wanted to take two Flemings to Iraq right now, I wouldn't even be allowed to leave,"" Rudi Vranckx told Studio Brussel this week."
NL_212	8	Fortunately, his new series Between War and Life and The Eternal War (the latter airs on Canvas starting today) have already been canned.
NL_212	9	Since Vranckx's visit to the country, unrest there has only increased, and for this reason.
NL_212	10	On Jan. 3, Iranian top general Qassem Soleimani died in a U.S. missile strike on Baghdad airport in Iraq.
NL_212	11	His power can hardly be overestimated and reached far beyond Iran's borders, into Lebanon.
NL_212	12	Thus, it was Soleimani's Shiite militias that (along with Kurdish fighters and in coordination with the U.S.) brought IS to a halt in Iraq.
NL_212	13	This is what Vali Nasr, professor of Middle East studies at the American John Hopkins University, tells us during Vranckx's interview with him for The Eternal War.
NL_212	14	The attack on Soleimani came after a series of escalations in December, again in Iraq.
NL_212	15	When a US soldier was killed there, the US eliminated dozens of members of the Shiite militia it held responsible: the Kata'ib Hezbollah.
NL_212	16	The Iranian response was not long in coming.
NL_212	17	For days, the U.S. Embassy in Iraq was stormed by Iraqi Shiites.
NL_212	18	It was then that US President Trump decided to kill Soleimani.
NL_212	19	However, during the war against IS, Iran built up a strong military presence in Iraq.
NL_212	20	In practice, it controls entire areas there.
NL_212	21	The Iranians, for whom US forces in their neighboring country are a thorn in their side, can use their militias as proxy pawns in the geopolitical chess game against the US.
NL_212	22	That is much more comfortable for Iran than an open war.
NL_212	23	Yesterday morning we already got an example of what such an Iranian countermove might look like, when Iran strafed two U.S. Army bases in Iraq.
NL_212	24	It is an atypical response, because for the first time this is a direct attack.
NL_212	25	Thus the Iraqis are increasingly drawn into a conflict that is not theirs.
NL_212	26	Iraq is a very rewarding geopolitical chessboard for the US and Iran.
NL_212	27	After all, the central government is not strong enough to make a fist against so much foreign violence within its own borders.
NL_212	28	Moreover, since October, violent popular protests have raged against the Iraqi rulers.
NL_212	29	They just can't get the country out of the doldrums.
NL_212	30	More than two years after the passage of IS, for example, they are still waiting in Mosul for reconstruction aid.
NL_212	31	And the economy also just doesn't get cranked up.
NL_212	32	Both Sunnis and Shiites are fed up with corruption and misrule, and are making it felt.
NL_212	33	Thus, the faltering Iraqi state is no match for Iran and the US.
NL_212	34	More to the point, Iran sees its opportunity to expand its influence even further, including in politics.
NL_212	35	But so much Iranian/Shiite muscle threatens to further strain sectarian tensions in Iraq (where the north is predominantly Sunni).
NL_229	1	Opinion Animal welfare Mandatory school trip to mega-stall or slaughterhouse Children may well realize the story behind their slice of sausage, thinks Anne Grefkens.
NL_229	2	World Animal Day is the annual moment when people worldwide give their animals an extra treat.
NL_229	3	Pets, that is.
NL_229	4	Because while these pets receive treats and hugs, 1.7 million farm animals in the Netherlands go to the slaughterhouse that same day.
NL_229	5	A bitter truth we especially don't want to burden our children with too much.
NL_229	6	This is a worrisome observation, because how do you teach children to make independent choices if they do not know what they are choosing?
NL_229	7	It is therefore time to scratch the sugar coating off the Dutch educational culture and make school trips to megastalls or slaughterhouses part of the curriculum.
NL_229	8	The truth is simply not sugar-coated: people kill animals before a slice of ham, a frikandel or a leg of chicken is on your plate.
NL_229	9	Anne Grefkens is a journalist at Univers (Tilburg University) and a philosopher.
NL_229	10	But what do we really think such a visit will accomplish?
NL_229	11	Since time immemorial, animals have been on the menu and part of human nature.
NL_229	12	Even primal man was already eating animals.
NL_229	13	Man was and remains a carnivore, it is argued.
NL_229	14	A visit to a mega-stall or slaughterhouse won't make the difference in food choices for a child, will it?
NL_229	15	But it is precisely this argument that no longer holds water.
NL_229	16	When the meat lover refers to primal man and human nature, it also indirectly refers to how the hunter catches, slaughters and prepares his prey.
NL_229	17	Something modern man today can barely imagine.
NL_229	18	Rarely do we see Henk, Ingrid and other Dutchmen still wielding a spear or handbow.
NL_229	19	Let alone catch, kill and skin their own prey.
NL_229	20	Peppa Pig.
NL_229	21	This modern society is slightly different.
NL_229	22	It is the farmers who raise the animals, the butcher who slaughters the animal and the supermarkets who sell the meat.
NL_229	23	Therefore, today's meat consumers are nothing like the aforementioned primal man: simply because they do not really know what is on their plate.
NL_229	24	Therefore, eating meat today is more part of human culture than human nature.
NL_229	25	It is this alienation that also does not leave philosopher Peter Singer unmoved.
NL_229	26	In his book Animal Liberation, he explains how words like cutlet, steak and sausage are misleading.
NL_229	27	These words are far removed from what we actually eat; an animal.
NL_229	28	In this he has a point: as a child, did you ask the butcher for a slice of sausage or a slice of dead cow?
NL_229	29	The same is true of the television programs young children grow up with.
NL_229	30	Unlike most meat industry pigs, Peppa Pig happily plays in the grass with her friends.
NL_229	31	By the way, this does not mean that eating meat is a crime.
NL_229	32	But if we expect the future generation of consumers to make wise choices, they need to know what they are choosing.
NL_229	33	An honest picture of our meat culture is therefore essential.
NL_229	34	Children may well realize that the animals they see in a mega-stall or slaughterhouse are the same animals on their plates at night.
NL_229	35	Therefore, a mandatory school trip to a mega-stall or the slaughterhouse would not be out of place in the educational curriculum.
NL_233	1	"Crematoria Beijing working overtime, fears of further advance coronavirus 12:04 in Foreign ""We burn from morning to night."
NL_233	2	"The furnaces can't handle it."""
NL_233	3	Other media confirm this picture.
NL_233	4	Radio Free Asia read on social media from a hospital employee that his hospital must wait five to seven days before the remains of a deceased patient can be taken to a crematorium.
NL_233	5	Someone from a funeral home told the same medium that cremations continue 24 hours a day.
NL_233	6	The Volkskrant correspondent writes that hospitals, crematoria and private bereavement centers have too little refrigeration space.
NL_233	7	Next of kin therefore choose to cremate the deceased as soon as possible, while the body is normally preserved for about five days to say goodbye according to traditions.
NL_233	8	An additional problem is that staff at crematoria and hospitals are calling in sick in droves because they themselves have been infected.
NL_233	9	China correspondent Garrie van Pinxteren.
NL_233	10	"""It is becoming increasingly clear that the omikron variant is around here."
NL_233	11	We don't hear that from authorities, but in surveys on social media, some 58 percent of people say they were infected with omikron in December.
NL_233	12	Among foreigners, it is about 68 percent.
NL_233	13	Well those are not reliable and representative figures, but they are pretty much all we have.
NL_233	14	And it matches how you hear all around you that people are or have been infected now.
NL_233	15	It is dead quiet on the streets here in Beijing.
NL_233	16	People who do take to the streets often have very good masks on and they are also people who have to do it for a living, such as delivery drivers.
NL_233	17	They are often late because there are few delivery people and there is a lot of demand for them.
NL_233	18	Many delivery drivers have also already returned to their home village because there is so much corona here in Beijing.
NL_233	19	No one thinks: it's just a cold and we'll go back to our normal lives.
NL_233	20	"It's mostly very cold and quiet anyway."""
NL_233	21	After widespread protests against the zerocovid policy, China abandoned this successful but extremely strict policy early this month.
NL_233	22	Scientists fear the virus could spread quickly, since most people have not yet been infected, and the death toll will skyrocket.
NL_233	23	Some models foresee a peak next March, with 20,000 deaths a day and all told a million deaths.
NL_233	24	Earlier, researchers from Shanghai University arrived at a figure of 1.6 million deaths.
NL_233	25	The official death toll now stands at more than 5,200.
NL_239	1	Feyenoord dreams aloud of Coolsingel:
NL_239	2	'We believe in the championship'
NL_239	3	Whether Marcus Pedersen has ever heard of the word championship fever, asks a reporter in the press room.
NL_239	4	The maker of the winning 2-1 in the absolute closing stages against AZ shows an uneasy smile behind the desk.
NL_239	5	The Norwegian has no idea what he is being asked because he does not understand Dutch.
NL_239	6	"After explaining in English, Pedersen says what everyone in and around De Kuip is thinking after the final final whistle at Feyenoord-AZ: ""I think now a lot of people believe we can become champions."""
NL_239	7	Tens of thousands of scarves went up in De Kuip after Feyenoord's hard-fought win was a fact.
NL_239	8	With 12 games to go, more and more Rotterdammers are becoming convinced of the title chances of their club, which last became champions in 2017.
NL_239	9	With the win in a direct confrontation, Feyenoord put number two AZ five points behind, although Ajax can move up to three points on Sunday.
NL_239	10	An added advantage for Feyenoord: until the topper against Ajax on March 19, there are three relatively easy duels on the schedule, against Fortuna Sittard (away), FC Groningen (at home) and FC Volendam (at home).
NL_239	11	The k-word (championship) is no longer shunned in the locker room, even though it is cursed by Feyenoord's fatalistic supporters.
NL_239	12	"Pedersen: ""Of course we talk about it."
NL_239	13	We believe in it.
NL_239	14	"We motivate each other extra at trainings and all fight to become champions."""
NL_239	15	Slot also seems increasingly optimistic after cautious answers about the title fight.
NL_239	16	He notes with satisfaction that his team took another step forward by winning a bad game for the first time this season.
NL_239	17	"""And teams that finish high often win lesser games,"" he knows."
NL_239	18	After the winter break, Feyenoord had failed to win against Ajax (1-1), FC Twente (1-1) and PSV (2-2).
NL_239	19	"But not pronouncing that Feyenoord should be champions, Slot does not, even though he realizes his team is in ""very good"" shape in the title race."
NL_239	20	"""We do not play over the competition like Napoli does in Italy, we have not once led 4-0 at halftime."
NL_239	21	"We have to put in a lot of effort to win a game."""
NL_239	22	Therein also lies the strength of Feyenoord, which has without a doubt the fittest and most resilient team in the Eredivisie.
NL_239	23	Already eight times this season the Rotterdammers conceded the opening goal without a defeat.
NL_239	24	No Eredivisie club picked up as many points (eighteen) as Feyenoord after falling behind.
NL_239	25	Against AZ, the proof was again provided.
NL_239	26	Feyenoord fell behind and played poor soccer, but did win thanks to an extremely fortunate goal by Pedersen in the 90th minute.
NL_239	27	His shot with his left leg changed direction and arced over AZ goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
NL_239	28	Whether that was the luck of the upcoming champion?
NL_239	29	Lock leaves that in the middle.
NL_239	30	"""If you want to be champions, you have to play better soccer than we did today."
NL_239	31	"But Michael Jordan once said, the harder I worked, the luckier I got."""
NL_242	1	How to prevent a second Maidan?
NL_242	2	This is how Russian police tackle demonstrations
NL_242	3	Another day of protest in Moscow, with mass arrests:
NL_242	4	according to activist site OVD-Info, a total of 1,377 arrests were made Saturday.
NL_242	5	According to sources from TV channel Dozhd, people in the Kremlin are worried.
NL_242	6	"The weeks of protests against the exclusion of the opposition in the municipal elections could well grow into an ""Orange Revolution,"" a reference to the Maidan uprising in Ukraine."
NL_242	7	For now, that scenario does not seem to be on the cards.
NL_242	8	But the army of security forces that cordoned off central Moscow on Saturday showed that President Putin wants nothing left to chance.
NL_242	9	The protest in Moscow was stifled according to a tight script, which looks broadly like this: 1.
NL_242	10	Pretending to talk.
NL_242	11	An unusually high number of opposition candidates have filed for the municipal elections, but none of them will be allowed to run on Sept. 8.
NL_242	12	According to the Moscow Electoral Council, some of the thousands of signatures collected by the candidates are not in order - which the opposition disputes.
NL_242	13	Consultations were held last week with Ella Pamfilova, the chairman of the Central Election Commission.
NL_242	14	"The authorities additionally authorized a one-time ""legal"" demonstration, on July 20."
NL_242	15	The message to the people:
NL_242	16	with the Kremlin is quite negotiable - the opposition is unreasonable.
NL_242	17	2. Threatening.
NL_242	18	Over the past week, Russian prosecutors conducted searches of the homes of several opposition leaders.
NL_242	19	Justice announced that it had launched an investigation into a protest in front of the Moscow Election Commission office.
NL_242	20	Organizing an illegal demonstration is a relatively minor offense, for which opposition leader Alexei Navalny has already been sentenced several times - usually to 30 days' arrest.
NL_242	21	"But ""obstructing"" the work of the electoral commission is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison."
NL_242	22	Moreover, by deploying this article of the law, the authorities issued a warning to Muscovites planning to demonstrate: this could end badly.
NL_242	23	In the days before the demonstration, several anonymous sources around City Hall reported that this time the crackdown would be harsher than usual. 3.
NL_242	24	Preventive apprehension of leaders.
NL_242	25	Opposition leader Aleksey Navalny was already detained on his run on Wednesday.
NL_242	26	On Saturday morning, many others followed: Ivan Zhdanov, the head of his anti-corruption organization, Navalny's lawyer Lyubov Sobol, former Duma member Dmitri Goedkov.
NL_242	27	Ilya Yashin, chairman of the Moscow borough of Krasnoselsky, was even transferred to a cell in a Moscow suburb.
NL_242	28	No leader therefore managed to address the crowd in central Moscow.
NL_242	29	Lyubov Sobol was even stopped for a second time Saturday, when she was dressed in the Russian flag on her way to the center.
NL_242	30	The Russian National Guard numbers more than 340,000 men Photo Reuters. 4.
NL_242	31	Excess.
NL_242	32	"The Russian National Guard - during the Soviet Union they were still called ""Internal Security Forces"" - numbers over 340,000 men - a Praetorian Guard of staggering size."
NL_242	33	Last Saturday, several thousand protesters faced many thousands of security forces.
NL_242	34	The authorities had so many men at their disposal that they were able to cordon off not only City Hall but the entire downtown area.
NL_242	35	Columns of ME officers also managed to set up lines among the protesting crowd, splitting the masses.
NL_242	36	5. Not too much violence.
NL_242	37	The Maidan uprising in Kiev began when Ukrainian security forces brutally bludgeoned a student protest.
NL_242	38	But Russian authorities again kept the violence contained this Saturday.
NL_242	39	To break up the demonstration, Russian police used a familiar tool: mass arrests.
NL_242	40	Groups of officers pulled random protesters from the crowd and carried them off to the arrest vans.
NL_242	41	In the process, most protesters offered little resistance.
NL_242	42	Only in a few cases do police use the truncheon.
NL_242	43	OVD-Info reported the names of 25 protesters who suffered blows.
NL_242	44	Online news channel Baza reports 77 cases of assault.
NL_242	45	All in all, brute force remained absent and the police were able to leave the shields on the bus. 6.
NL_242	46	Check the news.
NL_242	47	The independent pay channel Dozhd reported all day on the unrest in central Moscow, and for the occasion the paywall had been taken down.

NL_247	4	And it is to be applauded that the city of the Golden Age has chosen to show through its map that Dutch history was not only written by men in leadership positions in the VOC.
NL_247	5	One of the post-colonial heroes who will also get a street, for example, is also Maria Ulfiah, a fighter for women's rights and the first female minister in the Indonesian cabinet in 1946.
NL_247	6	Another name is Tan Malaka, a communist leader, who incidentally was killed by supporters of Sukarno's republican government in 1949.
NL_247	7	In the journal Historia.id, Indonesian historian Bonnie Triyana raised the question of how come Sukarno himself, who along with Hatta is seen as the founder of the Republic of Indonesia, was not given a street name.
NL_247	8	Good question.
NL_247	9	Especially as today marks the 74th anniversary of the Japanese surrender on Aug. 15, 1945.
NL_247	10	With that, World War II really came to an end.
NL_247	11	And two days later on Aug. 17, Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed Indonesian freedom.
NL_247	12	Many people dwelling on the end of World War II this Thursday, however, do not see Sukarno as a hero.
NL_247	13	"Rather, they consider him a ""errand boy"" of the Japanese they hated."
NL_247	14	Commemorating tragic events in national history also means attempting to come to terms with that history.
NL_247	15	To move forward.
NL_247	16	On the Dutch side, during the Indonesia war, many children, women and men were killed by pemudas , young fighters.
NL_247	17	Often with unimaginable cruelty.
NL_247	18	Recognition of that suffering and also the suffering inflicted by Japanese soldiers during the occupation of the Dutch East Indies that is what is central on Aug. 15.
NL_247	19	But knowing that the complexity of past events requires later generations to look beyond them.
NL_247	20	So also be mindful of the fact that the Indonesian people suffered equally under the barbaric Japanese rule.
NL_247	21	And to realize that the war unleashed by the Dutch state after the proclamation of the Republic of Indonesia was also barbaric.
NL_247	22	"Rightly, then Minister Ben Bot (Foreign Affairs, CDA) admitted in 2005 that the Netherlands was ""on the wrong side of history"" in that war."
NL_247	23	Nevertheless, it took until 2012 before a Dutch ambassador, in light of the court ruling on the Rawagede case, conveyed an expression of regret to Jakarta.
NL_247	24	Indonesian historians are also beginning to look at what happened during the so-called bersiap period.
NL_247	25	"The admission that dirty hands were made during the ""glorious struggle"" for independence does not fit well with the nationalist founding myth, which has become particularly fashionable since former President Suharto."
NL_247	26	Self-examination can be healing for both countries and for mutual relations.
NL_247	27	Helpful would be if the Netherlands finally recognized Aug. 17 as Indonesia's founding date.
NL_247	28	In the end, not only that final colonial war was wrong.
NL_247	29	The Netherlands was already on the wrong side of history, to speak with Bot, the moment the VOC began exploiting the archipelago.
NL_253	1	Column Wilfried de Jong A final honorably lost and much goodwill gained Wilfried de Jong saw the Dutch soccer women lose to the United States.
NL_253	2	They have become trusted and congenial family friends.
NL_253	3	With red cheeks from excitement and nerves, they walked onto the field; full of courage, yet with a tough look here and there.
NL_253	4	Two hours later, the Dutch women stood silently on the grass; still with red cheeks, sharply turned on now by the salt of tears.
NL_253	5	For terrier Jackie Groenen, they kept rolling down the cheeks.
NL_253	6	And yet, grief was borne in style.
NL_253	7	The word pride fell.
NL_253	8	It was not a dream, nor a fairy tale.
NL_253	9	The Dutch soccer women's World Cup had everything of a mission.
NL_253	10	A professional act, feel free to call it a hunt, or in their terms, our hunt.
NL_253	11	Those who hunt dare to thrust the chest forward, shoot and fight when they can to eliminate the opponent.
NL_253	12	Wanting to smell the other person's sweat of fear, to taste the blood and flesh if necessary.
NL_253	13	The soccer women came very far in their fight, but after an easily given penalty for kicking too high and a distance shot, the team subsided and the Americans raced across the field in the final as the deserved champions.
NL_253	14	In this tournament, these soccer women - the lionesses, may also be - have become familiar and sympathetic family friends.
NL_253	15	"The favor factor of the ""Orange fighting machine"" was high, fueled by the cheerful mood and unanimity."
NL_253	16	Cynics increasingly swallowed criticism, even though the play shown was far from stylish.
NL_253	17	This team mattered, in the living room and at the coffee machine.
NL_253	18	A close-knit sports team without grumpiness with a calm, decisive coach.
NL_253	19	Then empathy comes naturally and you get into the skin of the soccer women.
NL_253	20	Feeling the pain along in Lieke Martens' toe, tapping a ball out of the goal with Sari van Veenendaal's fingertips, making a slide like Van de Donk and looking at the referee with that scowl-like face.
NL_253	21	NRC Sports.
NL_253	22	The final whistle at the Lyon stadium was wistful.
NL_253	23	Summer is only halfway over and the Dutch women will not show up on the field or on television for the next few months.
NL_253	24	Soccer fans will have to make do for a while with a vulgar hand-wringing over the salary of, and transfer fee for, Matthijs de Ligt and new kits for their favorite club.
NL_253	25	A final honorably lost and much goodwill gained.
NL_253	26	Children will fantasize about their favorite soccer wives and work up a sweat for hours on beach and camping grass.
NL_253	27	A slalom à la Miedema, Spitse's kicking technique, diving for ball with mint green gloves, dribbling like Lieke.
NL_253	28	Just before collecting the silver medal, the soccer women and coaching staff sought each other out and, like after all the other games, stood in a circle that happened to take the shape of a heart.
NL_253	29	Coach Sarina Wiegman took the floor.
NL_253	30	Shoulder to shoulder everyone hung against each other.
NL_253	31	They watched the field of the lost final and listened, the soccer women.
NL_253	32	Tired and empty, but unbroken.
NL_261	1	Calling teachers:
NL_261	2	investigate first, then suspend
NL_261	3	The incidents differ.
NL_261	4	Kennemer College in Heemskerk has since apologized to the teaching assistant who was suspended.
NL_261	5	The man had grabbed a student's neck during a conflict.
NL_261	6	The teacher who viewed pornographic photos during a lesson at Staring College in Lochem will not return to his school.
NL_261	7	At Hoofdvaart College in Hoofddorp, there is discussion about what exactly happened in the classroom.
NL_261	8	"The school board wrote in a letter that the technology instructor had told students that Prophet Muhammad ""was married to an eight-year-old girl and that in the Netherlands an adult who marries an eight-year-old girl is considered a pedophile."""
NL_261	9	According to the technology instructor, the discussion was not about Prophet Muhammad.
NL_261	10	The man is challenging his suspension with the Education Disputes Board.
NL_261	11	Wrong signal.
NL_261	12	In the Lower House, VVD, PVV and Christian Union are outraged by the issue.
NL_261	13	They feel that the school especially should have made it clear to students that the teacher can just say this.
NL_261	14	The school did not act properly, also believes Liesbeth Verheggen, president of education union AOb.
NL_261	15	She calls the suspension of the engineering instructor a wrong signal.
NL_261	16	"""The board must express confidence in the teacher."
NL_261	17	What they did here is say to the teacher: go home temporarily.
NL_261	18	"That sends the wrong message because we say: school board show you have confidence in teacher professionalism."""
NL_261	19	What is it like for students when an accused teacher continues to teach, wonders Jordy Klaas of the Landelijk Aktie Komitee Scholieren (LAKS).
NL_261	20	"""It will vary from situation to situation, but it has to remain workable."
NL_261	21	If many students have filed a complaint against a particular teacher, I can imagine that he or she will not teach for a while.
NL_261	22	This is better for both the students and the teacher.
NL_261	23	The school board must find out the truth during that time.
NL_261	24	"If it turns out that students have been lied to, action must be taken against them."""
NL_261	25	It's a choice between two evils for school boards, says the General Association of School Leaders.
NL_261	26	On the one hand, they want to protect the vulnerable position of their teachers; at the same time, they are also responsible for providing a safe learning environment for children.
NL_261	27	"""What we see is that school leaders have to balance the interests between teachers, parents, staff and students,"" said AVS President Petra van Haren."
NL_261	28	"""In the cases where teachers are suspended, the interest of the student prevailed."
NL_261	29	"But you can never say that's always the case, it's always a case by case."""
NL_261	30	More incidents?
NL_261	31	Last year, more than a quarter of high school teachers had to deal with students cursing, intimidating or even using physical violence against their teacher, a survey of more than a thousand teachers by research firm DUO showed in November.
NL_261	32	Whether there has been an increase in school incidents, union AOb cannot say.
NL_261	33	Incidents in schools are of all times.
NL_261	34	What has changed recently, however, is the fact that incidents are now filmed and can be shared with all the world via social media.
NL_261	35	They understand that in class at Windesheim, too.
NL_261	36	Watching these incidents, one of the students sometimes wonders why he chose this course again.
NL_261	37	"But he doesn't let it stop him: ""I know I really enjoy being in front of the class."
NL_261	38	"There are risks associated with every profession, and in this course you are trained to deal with them."""
NL_263	1	'Bonnet terror in Germany:
NL_263	2	2.2 million kilometers of paper per year'
NL_263	3	Since Jan. 1, 2020, Germans have been required to carry a receipt with every transaction.
NL_263	4	Whether it's a sandwich at the bakery or a coffee-to-go at the train station, a receipt must always be printed.
NL_263	5	The measure was introduced to combat tax evasion, but is causing much irritation.
NL_263	6	Daily Die Welt calculated that the measure leads to 2.2 million kilometers of receipts every year.
NL_263	7	That is more than fifty times the circumference of the earth.
NL_263	8	Many of these receipts are made of thermal paper that is harmful to health and cannot be burned.
NL_263	9	Not only because of environmental concerns is there criticism.
NL_263	10	The measure would also be unnecessarily bureaucratic and expensive.
NL_263	11	Business owners must pay for paper costs and the cost of a new or updated cash register themselves.
NL_263	12	Added value?
NL_263	13	"The receipt requirement is part of the Treasury Department's ""Cashier's Bill,"" which dates back to 2016."
NL_263	14	The law contains several measures to combat tax evasion.
NL_263	15	The German court of auditors estimated that the state was losing up to 10 billion in tax revenue annually due to manipulated cash registers.
NL_263	16	Each printed receipt proves that a transaction was correctly recorded.
NL_263	17	But the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), which represents the German retail industry, questions on its website whether the physical voucher adds value.
NL_263	18	According to the new law, all digital cash registers must be equipped with software that prevents the subsequent modification or deletion of transactions.
NL_263	19	Whether or not the customer receives a receipt then does not matter, says tax expert Ralph Brügelmann of the HDE.
NL_263	20	Controversial everywhere.
NL_263	21	Berlin household goods retailer Paul Helmich also sees no point in the receipt requirement.
NL_263	22	"""Against tax evasion, it will not help."
NL_263	23	The law is already a few years old.
NL_263	24	"People who really want to commit fraud have had plenty of time to figure something out."""
NL_263	25	Before the new measure took effect, Helmich printed a receipt only if a customer requested it.
NL_263	26	Now about 200 receipts end up in his trash every day.
NL_263	27	The law also creates divisions within the governing coalition.
NL_263	28	In December, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) warned his fellow Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) in a critical letter.
NL_263	29	"""The implications of this measure are significant,"" he wrote."
NL_263	30	Altmaier would prefer that customers receive a voucher only when they request it and will work to amend the law, he told
NL_263	31	Not unique.
NL_263	32	With its receipt requirement, Germany is not unique within the EU.
NL_263	33	In Austria, Belgium, France, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Portugal, such an arrangement has existed for years.
NL_263	34	In Italy, they have known no different since 1987.
NL_284	1	The hearing The tenant with the short fuse Abdelaziz el J. (36) is suspected of threatening employees of a housing association.
NL_284	2	When the housing association's lawyer calls him for the fourth time, the bile overflows at Abdelaziz el J.
NL_284	3	"""I am tbs,"" he tells her."
NL_284	4	"""And I'm going to kill you."""
NL_284	5	"According to the lawyer's notes, El J. also mentioned ""bullets in the mailbox"" during that conversation."
NL_284	6	He had to return the keys to the landlord after an escalating conflict, people in the building were afraid of him, but he did not.
NL_284	7	El J. has threatened several people with death because of his residence, according to the president.
NL_284	8	"""I'm going to beat the cancer out of him,"" he told someone who answered the phone at a sheltered housing facility about another employee."
NL_284	9	"""I have nine bullets, I'm going to kill your colleague, kill one of you, I swear."""
NL_284	10	"""The thing is,"" says Abdelaziz el J."
NL_284	11	In the home he was assigned two years ago, cables were hanging out of the wall from the moment he moved in, there was a crack in one of the windows, and the former occupant had also left her old cabinets.
NL_284	12	"""Surely that can't be."""
NL_284	13	He starts talking faster and faster.
NL_284	14	"""There was wáter coming in when it rained."
NL_284	15	"For twelve months I asked very normally if they would make it, but they didn't."""
NL_284	16	And then El J. started threatening.
NL_284	17	He is silent for a moment, then shakes his head.
NL_284	18	"""That woman [from the housing association] said I should be glad I had four rooms."
NL_284	19	Four!
NL_284	20	Why four?
NL_284	21	I am alone with my cat.
NL_284	22	"And there is housing shortage."""
NL_284	23	El J. is a compact man with a bald head and dark, expressive eyebrows.
NL_284	24	His face can shift from thunderstorm to sunny within a second - and back again.
NL_284	25	"According to the presiding judge, people know El J. as someone who is ""more often excited about what happens to him."""
NL_284	26	El J. nods.
NL_284	27	"""Short fuse, ma'am."
NL_284	28	And I have a squeak in my ear.
NL_284	29	I've always been like this.
NL_284	30	"My family and sisters know that too."""
NL_284	31	Tenant El J. wants psychological help, but the prosecutor thinks punishment is the only solution.
NL_284	32	The chairman explained that El J. is here because the prosecutor feels that the way he is trying to make a point goes way too far.
NL_284	33	Three people filed charges against him.
NL_284	34	Indicators said they feared for their lives.
NL_284	35	Several employees of the housing association no longer dare sit in certain areas of the building because they fear that El J. - as he also announced - would drive into the building.
NL_284	36	"""Maybe it's not true at all that they fear for their lives,"" he says."
NL_284	37	"""Maybe you underestimate how scared they are,"" said the chairman."
NL_284	38	El J. understands that he should not have threatened, he says several times, but he felt impotent.
NL_284	39	What else should he have done to get his house in order?
NL_284	40	The president says to El J. that he has a history of getting himself into trouble, because there are other cases pending against him as well - even though he is not a tbs man, as he said in a threat, according to the housing association lawyer.
NL_284	41	Why is that?
NL_284	42	"""Because of my youth,"" he says."
NL_284	43	"""Others went to school with a sandwich and I went to school without a sandwich."
NL_284	44	"Was often home alone."""
NL_284	45	"A little later, ""I feel there is no place for me in this society."""
NL_284	46	El J. is quite willing to get psychological help for his short fuse, he says.
NL_284	47	But according to the prosecutor, the probation department offered him help in the past that he did not take.
NL_284	48	"""Therefore, punishment is now the only solution."""
NL_284	49	El J.'s lawyer doubts that what her client did was serious enough to be punishable.
NL_284	50	Although El J. admits he made threats, he says he did not say anything to the lawyer about murders or bullets.
NL_284	51	"""So it's her word against his."""
NL_284	52	"And do the people who have been threatened have the ""reasonable fear"" that must be demonstrated for a conviction?"
NL_284	53	For example, the employee of the assisted living facility was threatened through the telephone operator.
NL_284	54	El J. faces a one-month prison sentence, about half of which he has already served on remand.
NL_292	1	Today at 11:12 Navo consults on missile strike, but Article 4 appears to be off the table
NL_292	2	Poland would ultimately not invoke Article 4 of the NATO Treaty after all.
NL_292	3	More and more signs indicate that the missile that struck Poland last night did not come from Russia, but was defenses from Ukraine.
NL_292	4	According to Reuters news agency, US President Joe Biden informed his G7 and NATO colleagues that the missile that killed two in the Polish border village of Przewodów on Tuesday night was a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile.
NL_292	5	So it would not be an attack or a miss from Russia.
NL_292	6	It was already clear yesterday that Article 5 would most likely not be used, so now Article 4 also seems to be off the table for good.
NL_292	7	Article... 4?
NL_292	8	Yes, four.
NL_292	9	After eight months of war in Ukraine, Article 5 of NATO is well enough known - an attack on one is an attack on all.
NL_292	10	Article 4 can be seen as a prelude to Article 5.
NL_292	11	It reads: ' The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened. ' That means that when a member state feels threatened, it can invoke this article.
NL_292	12	The North Atlantic Council (NAC) then meets to discuss the situation and possible threat.
NL_292	13	Afterwards, a joint position will then follow or measures may be announced.
NL_292	14	NATO council does meet.
NL_292	15	Direct military action is not to be expected after such an Article 4 meeting.
NL_292	16	After all, there is Article 5 for that, but then there must be an attack on a NATO member state.
NL_292	17	That is not the case here, and Poles would even now feel that there is not enough reason to reach for 4.
NL_292	18	That does not mean there are no NATO consultations today.
NL_292	19	That is indeed going on.
NL_292	20	Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg leads a meeting of the Council and there is also a full day of consultations at the level of military intelligence.
NL_292	21	This afternoon, Stoltenberg will hold a press conference.
NL_292	22	Only, much of the aplomb is taken away by not reaching for Article 4.
NL_292	23	For eight months, NATO has been doing its best to provoke as little as possible.
NL_292	24	After all, the consequences of rash reactions or statements can be immense.
NL_292	25	If the NATO really gets involved in the conflict, we will end up in a Third World War.
NL_292	26	Article 4 is popular.
NL_292	27	Whereas Article 5 has only been invoked once, by the United States after the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, the threshold for Article 4 is lower.
NL_292	28	It has already been used seven times.
NL_292	29	The last time was early this year, on the day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Feb. 24.
NL_292	30	Then Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Poland invoked Article 4.
NL_292	31	NATO then immediately met for consultations and afterwards made it clear that an attack on NATO territory would not be without consequences.
NL_292	32	Navo's eastern flank has been greatly strengthened since then.
NL_292	33	Turkey has already used Article 4 most often.
NL_292	34	It happened in July 2015 after a terrorist attack that killed 32 people.
NL_292	35	The Turks' main concern at the time was to make clear how seriously they took the situation and to inform their NATO partners of the measures they would take.
NL_292	36	After the meeting, NATO condemned the attacks but took no further action.
NL_292	37	The Turks also pulled the NATO alarm bell in 2012.
NL_292	38	First after Syrian anti-aircraft defenses took a Turkish fighter plane out of the sky, and a second time after five Turkish civilians fell victim to Syrian bombs.
NL_292	39	The Turks then requested and received additional anti-aircraft defenses from their NATO partners.
NL_292	40	Poles have also known the Article 4 procedure for some time.
NL_292	41	In March 2014, the country convened NATO because of the tense situation in neighboring Ukraine.
NL_292	42	Russia had then just annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.
NL_296	1	Mandy Ginsberg seduces singles and investors
NL_296	2	'Twelve years ago there was a stigma attached to online dating.
NL_296	3	Couples lied and said they met through friends.
NL_296	4	Today, 35 percent of marriages start online, compared to 3 percent when I started.'
NL_296	5	In Harvard Business Review, 49-year-old Mandy Ginsberg, the CEO of publicly traded Match Group, the world's biggest player thanks to its flagship product Tinder, outlines the breakthrough of online dating.
NL_296	6	"""Back then, dating sites were only accessible via a desk or laptop, today a 25-year-old Tinder user considers that as antique as a fax machine,"" writes Ginsberg, who came on board at Match Group in 2006 and has been its CEO since last January."
NL_296	7	"""Our products run almost entirely on apps and smartphones."
NL_296	8	Like no other, Ginsberg entices the world's singles with dozens of dating services à la Tinder, such as Meetic and Hinge of Pairs, through which Match Group spans more than 190 countries and 42 languages.
NL_296	9	It also houses the dating app Twoo, founded by Ghent entrepreneurs Lorenz Bogaert and Toon Coppens.
NL_296	10	Wednesday, Match Group shares popped 27 percent higher after Ginsberg served up good second-quarter figures.
NL_296	11	Revenue of $498 million was 18 percent higher than a year earlier; operating profit clocked in at $173 million, 15 percent higher.
NL_296	12	The explosive growth of the childishly simple Tinder - you swipe left or right on a photo, according to your taste - remains by far the cash cow. 5.2 million users subscribed last quarter, 1.5 million more than a year ago.
NL_296	13	"""Before Tinder, relatively few people under 30 were doing online dating,"" Ginsberg outlines."
NL_296	14	"""Today, most users are 18- to 25-year-olds who also own two, three other dating apps, which reinforces our multi-brand strategy."
NL_296	15	Ginsberg herself suffered her share of setbacks in love.
NL_296	16	Her first marriage foundered shortly after she took out a loan for an MBA at American Wharton.
NL_296	17	'I suddenly found myself alone with a one-year-old child,' she said.
NL_296	18	"""An experience that changed my life, but I graduated stronger than ever."
NL_296	19	Ginsberg is guided by female role models.
NL_296	20	'I grew up in a matriarchal environment, with a very strong mother.
NL_296	21	Career expectations were high for me and my two sisters.
NL_296	22	Shortly after she took office as Match CEO, she wanted to make sure female employees had the same opportunities as men.
NL_296	23	An outside auditor had to figure out whether women were paid equally.
NL_296	24	When it turned out that it was, she had it double-checked.
NL_296	25	Her dada is to give valuable employees a raise, whether they ask for it themselves or not.
NL_296	26	Ginsberg has since remarried, to an Indian.
NL_296	27	'He was the first in his family to fit for an arranged marriage,' she says in Harvard Business Review.
NL_296	28	With Match Group, Ginsberg is aiming for substantial growth in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America, where two in three singles have never used a dating product, similar to the U.S. and Europe in 2012.
NL_296	29	She already convinced 6 million Japanese, South Koreans and Taiwanese addicted to their smartphones to use the fast-growing Pairs.
NL_296	30	Ginsberg also invested in Egyptian dating app Harmonica, active in 33 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
NL_297	1	Man accidentally finds possible sex tape of R.
NL_297	2	Kelly: 'The hunt is on' Footage has resurfaced showing R.
NL_297	3	Kelly could be seen abusing underage girls.
NL_297	4	That was announced by attorney Gloria Allred at a press conference in New York.
NL_297	5	It is not yet clear whether the video is authentic.
NL_297	6	Kelly's lawyer denies that the singer can be seen.
NL_297	7	He speaks of a witch hunt against his client.
NL_297	8	The R&B singer was accused of sexually abusing four women last month.
NL_297	9	Three of them were said to be minors.
NL_297	10	Earlier, two other sex tapes surfaced showing R.
NL_297	11	Kelly would be on display.
NL_297	12	The singer now awaits his trial in freedom.
NL_297	13	The new images were found by a Pennsylvania couple.
NL_297	14	Gary Dennis was sorting through his videotape collection when he came across a tape marked 'R.'
NL_297	15	Kelly'.
NL_297	16	He thought it was about a concert of the singer recorded over a sports game.
NL_297	17	No concert.
NL_297	18	He played the tape.
NL_297	19	"""To my great surprise, I really saw R."
NL_297	20	"Kelly on the pictures, but not with a concert,"" Dennis said at the press conference."
NL_297	21	"""Instead, I saw him abusing underage black girls."""
NL_297	22	He did not go into further detail, except to say that he saw that R.
NL_297	23	Kelly told the girls what to do while he filmed them.
NL_297	24	Just last week, the singer said in an emotional interview with CBS that he is innocent.
NL_297	25	He denied all charges and says he is fighting for his life:
NL_297	26	Dennis has no idea how he got the footage.
NL_297	27	He says he has been given videotapes of sports games by friends in the past on occasion.
NL_297	28	Dennis decided to turn the footage over to Gloria Allred, who assists women who say they were abused by Kelly.
NL_297	29	The 77-year-old Allred is a well-known name in the American legal profession.
NL_297	30	She primarily does issues related to women's rights.
NL_297	31	Among other things, she defended dozens of women in cases against Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby.
NL_297	32	The lawyer stressed that Dennis and his wife have never had any contact with the singer.
NL_297	33	"She also said she cannot say with ""100 percent certainty"" that R."
NL_297	34	Kelly is also actually the man in the video footage.
NL_297	35	The footage is now being examined by police.
NL_297	36	'Not R.
NL_297	37	Kelly on the images' Allred also said she thinks there will be many more images of R.
NL_297	38	Kelly in circulation.
NL_297	39	She called on anyone with potentially incriminating material in their possession to share it with authorities.
NL_297	40	The attorney for R.
NL_297	41	Kelly says the singer is in the corner where the hits are.
NL_297	42	"""The doubt here is evidence enough,"" Steve Greenberg wrote in a response to AP news agency."
NL_297	43	He points out that Dennis says the man in the footage on R.
NL_297	44	Kelly seems.
NL_297	45	"""That doesn't make it him."
NL_297	46	He isn't.
NL_297	47	The hunt for R.
NL_297	48	"Kelly is clearly open."""
NL_M_006	1	Education is one of the most important building blocks of our society.
NL_M_006	2	Education provides opportunities and perspective and helps children, youth and adults discover and develop their talents.
NL_M_006	3	A school is a mini society in itself, a community of values.
NL_M_006	4	Teachers, school leaders and other educational personnel, together with parents, put their hearts and souls into the formation and development of our children.
NL_M_006	5	Thus, they offer children and young people the opportunity to develop as individuals, relate to others and dissenters, discover their place in society and develop their talents.
NL_M_006	6	In addition, education contributes significantly to the economic development and innovative capacity of our country and thus to our prosperity and well-being.
NL_M_006	7	The Netherlands has a unique educational system.
NL_M_006	8	Thanks to the freedom of education guaranteed in Article 23 of our Constitution, a diverse pool of government-funded schools and institutions has emerged.
NL_M_006	9	Parents, pupils and students can choose education that matches their upbringing and beliefs.
NL_M_006	10	Schools and institutions enjoy relative freedom and perform well, at internationally average costs.
NL_M_006	11	At the same time, education faces a number of persistent and growing problems.
NL_M_006	12	Thus, learning outcomes are under pressure, differences between schools are widening, segregation is increasing and equity of opportunity is declining.
NL_M_006	13	Teachers, pupils and students are experiencing increasing work and performance pressures.
NL_M_006	14	The teacher shortage is acute and is felt hardest in schools where equal educational opportunity is already under pressure.
NL_M_006	15	The Christian Union therefore invests in teachers so that they have time and space to bring children's talents to fruition.
NL_M_006	16	And we also invest in the quality of education so that students receive the best education.
NL_M_006	17	We also give schools additional resources for the professional development of teachers and school leaders.
NL_M_006	18	We invest in high-quality knowledge and skilled professionals, working toward a future-proof economy in an increasingly complex world.
NL_M_006	19	Core concepts for good educational policy are freedom of choice, trust, responsibility and professionalism.
NL_M_006	20	The richness of education cannot be captured in indicators and numbers, its greatest value lies in its pedagogical dimension: the interaction between teacher and student, in which the student increasingly blossoms and, through trial and error, learns to know his possibilities and limits.
NL_M_006	21	Thinking from these concepts, the Christian Union wants to contribute to solving the challenges facing education.
NL_M_007	1	Whether looking into the eyes of a traumatized refugee in a UNHCR refugee camp, or hearing from migrant workers living in bunk beds on a Dutch industrial estate, or noticing from residents that they feel abandoned by the segregation in their vulnerable neighborhood, or hearing from doctors how they had to rescue people from the Mediterranean Sea.
NL_M_007	2	With migration, there is much glaring injustice associated with it, and we do too little about it.
NL_M_007	3	We as a country have been struggling with migration for the past 20 years in particular, and the result of that struggle is simply not good enough.
NL_M_007	4	We are stuck with an unjust and overly strict refugee policy that is completely bogged down at Europe's borders and hung together with overwrought rhetoric.
NL_M_007	5	A political majority is not even willing to accommodate a small group of vulnerable minor children from the camps on Lesbos.
NL_M_007	6	Meanwhile, we leave labor migration almost entirely to corporations, when in scope and social impact it has a far greater impact on our society than the arrival of vulnerable refugees.
NL_M_007	7	Change is needed quickly.
NL_M_007	8	The Christian Union wants a fairer migration policy that is more welcoming and humane to refugees and gives more control over labor migration.
NL_M_007	9	We must not again - as happened in the last century - make the mistake of narrowing migration to a calculus about our need in the labor market.
NL_M_007	10	Migration policy is also about the soul of our nation, about who we are as a country.
NL_M_007	11	On how we can welcome people into our society and our rule of law.
NL_M_007	12	About our responsibility to stand up for the heartbreaking plight of the world's many refugees, who are not looking for work, but rather for safety and protection.
NL_M_007	13	About the courage needed to work better together in Europe to stop the injustice to refugees - nota bene on our own continent.
NL_M_007	14	About the economic inequality on earth, which often causes migrants to search in vain for a better future in another country, resulting in much exploitation and injustice.
NL_M_007	15	About the real concerns of local residents who have had to cope with the effects of migration and failed integration policies in their working-class neighborhoods for years, without political attention.
NL_M_007	16	About our democratic rule of law and the foundations of our society.
NL_M_007	17	If we don't take all these things into account, things will go wrong.
NL_M_007	18	Visionless migration can disrupt communities and strain long-term social peace.
NL_M_007	19	That's why we want a different migration policy: fair and welcoming.
NL_M_007	20	Looking out for the needs of refugees is close to the heart of Christian politics.
NL_M_007	21	We were all made and loved by the same God, and the land we live in was just given to us.
NL_M_007	22	We therefore have a principled belief that we must provide a safe haven for victims of disaster, war, persecution and oppression.
NL_M_007	23	The Netherlands shares with other countries in the world a responsibility for their fate.
NL_M_007	24	Unfortunately, it is not inconceivable that the number of refugees will increase further in the coming years due to geopolitical instability and climate change, among other factors.
NL_M_007	25	If we see human dignity as one of the core values of our own country, then we cannot afford to look away from it.
NL_M_007	26	This does not mean that we as a community can take on the shoulders all the suffering in the world, but we can and should do our part.
NL_M_007	27	By supporting refugee reception worldwide.
NL_M_007	28	And by implementing fairer and better policies in the Netherlands and in Europe, in which hospitality and humanity are paramount.
NL_M_007	29	Caring for all refugees, from refugee camps worldwide to asylum seekers' centers in the Netherlands
NL_M_019	1	The PVV loves the Netherlands.
NL_M_019	2	We love our own culture, identity and traditions.
NL_M_019	3	So we always want to put those first!
NL_M_019	4	The left-liberal elite has done exactly the opposite in recent years.
NL_M_019	5	"The ""away with us"" mentality has been elevated to an art and has struck everywhere - from media to education."
NL_M_019	6	Our history is being erased, our traditions ridiculed and our identity squandered.
NL_M_019	7	A society is being created in which the Dutch must adapt to migrants rather than the other way around.
NL_M_019	8	Indeed, the Dutch themselves are constantly disadvantaged and discriminated against.
NL_M_019	9	"We see this, for example, in social housing that is given priority to status holders or the ""positive discrimination"" in the labor market that makes native Dutch nationals less likely to get jobs."
NL_M_019	10	The PVV does not go along with this self-hatred.
NL_M_019	11	The PVV also does not go along with the view that all cultures are equal.
NL_M_019	12	We pronounce that our own culture is the best.
NL_M_019	13	And we are proud of that!
NL_M_019	14	Unfortunately, the attack on Dutch culture gained momentum last year with the glorification of dangerous activist groups like Black Lives Matter and Kick Out Zwarte Piet.
NL_M_019	15	These radical clubs label native Dutch people as racists and ensure that the tradition of Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet is thrown in the trash.
NL_M_019	16	Nauseating threats of violence are hereby conveniently condoned.
NL_M_019	17	"The extremist Akwasi who said he wanted to ""kick Black Pete in the face"" was called a ""word artist"" by Jesse Klaver."
NL_M_019	18	Everything shows that the politically-correct elite has taken sides against Holland.
NL_M_019	19	Why are people trying to kill the St. Nicholas tradition with Black Pete, but halal slaughter is allowed to continue?
NL_M_019	20	Why should the Dutch be ashamed of the history of slavery, but fail to mention that slavery was and still is a major problem in the Islamic world?
NL_M_019	21	Why are the Christmas tree and Easter under fire, while we see entire TV broadcasts on Ramadan?
NL_M_019	22	It is the world upside down.
NL_M_019	23	This politically-correct degradation of our own identity often receives support from education and public broadcasting.
NL_M_019	24	Partly for this reason, that public broadcasting should be abolished.
NL_M_019	25	Education should give ample attention to acquired Western freedoms, and to emphasize our Dutch character, it is nice to raise the Dutch flag in schools daily.
NL_M_019	26	It is very important to establish constitutionally that our Judeo-Christian and humanist roots are the dominant and guiding culture in the Netherlands.
NL_M_019	27	We end all government policies that undermine our Dutch culture.
NL_M_019	28	Consider the widespread diversity policy, all subsidies for multikul- clubs and government information in Arabic or Turkish.
NL_M_019	29	Initiatives to remove statues or street names of Dutch sea heroes, of course, belong to the sad politically-correct past.
NL_M_019	30	The Dutch love this country and will never, ever let it be taken away from them.
NL_M_019	31	The PVV wants to lead the way with all these proud Dutch people in the fight to protect our culture and traditions.
NL_M_019	32	We will not let ourselves be talked into racism and discrimination by those who would rather dissolve the Netherlands today than tomorrow.
NL_M_019	33	The Netherlands is a beautiful country with a fantastic culture that we will always protect.
NL_M_023	1	For decades, a retreating government was considered the recipe for a good business climate, economic growth and rising people's prosperity.
NL_M_023	2	Those goals are still leading for us, but we have to critically review the recipe, because the market alone has not always been able to manage this well on its own.
NL_M_023	3	During the liberal struggle against too big and patronizing government, the power of some private parties has sometimes slipped through.
NL_M_023	4	Technological developments are rapidly growing companies into monopolies, or have created companies that can make billions in sales without contributing enough to society.
NL_M_023	5	Our tax rules are not prepared for a digitizing economy, allowing companies to make profits without actually being based in a country.
NL_M_023	6	This makes it difficult for countries to tax these companies.
NL_M_023	7	The majority of businesses do contribute to society, and also suffer from these excesses.
NL_M_023	8	So it is in the best interest of business itself if we put a check on these excesses, because that is how we protect most well-intentioned businesses from unfair competition.
NL_M_023	9	This protection is crucial, because we owe our prosperity to our entrepreneurs and all the hard-working Dutch people, and they will also have to provide the economic growth that is badly needed to help us out of the corona crisis in the coming years.
NL_M_023	10	But if the algorithm of one search engine, booking site or meal delivery company determines which local business owner comes into consumers' view, it is as stifling to SMEs as too many government regulations.
NL_M_023	11	The Netherlands cannot do without its entrepreneurs, large and small, and companies need a healthy business climate.
NL_M_023	12	This can only exist when the government acts as market master against excesses.
NL_M_023	13	On top of that, in a modern economy, not all businesses deal in tangible products.
NL_M_023	14	"For example, data about individuals and their consumer behavior is the ""raw material"" with which digital platforms are making gold."
NL_M_023	15	To make sure that this trade is done according to our rules, to strengthen control, and to increase the possibilities that we can tax it, we need to make sure that the data is stored in European centers and subject to European laws.
NL_M_023	16	Even through its own investments, the government will involve itself more actively in the economy than we have been used to in recent decades.
NL_M_023	17	That is why the government has created a 20-billion-euro fund to spend on innovation, infrastructure and education where the market will not.
NL_M_023	18	After all, while a fast rail link between two cities strengthens the Dutch economy as a whole, it is not the kind of project a private investor makes money from directly.
NL_M_023	19	Nor can we ignore the fact that geopolitics and economics are becoming more intertwined.
NL_M_023	20	Increasingly, entrepreneurs face unfair competition from foreign, state-run companies.
NL_M_023	21	This also creates the undesirable effect that if we privatize a port, for example, another country can take control through a state-owned company.
NL_M_023	22	Then privatization does not lead to market forces but to strategic dependence.
NL_M_023	23	These changes make it necessary that we strengthen the role of government as market master and make changes so that the creativity of capitalism and the free market work for people again.
NL_M_025	1	The use of fossil fuels has never been an end in itself, but only a means.
NL_M_025	2	It enables large groups of people to live in heated homes, to have light even at night, and to move long distances by trains, cars and planes.
NL_M_025	3	If we can achieve the same effects with clean energy sources, then there is no reason to stick with gasoline or coal.
NL_M_025	4	The earthquakes in Groningen also show that we cannot continue to extract natural gas safely everywhere in the Netherlands.
NL_M_025	5	In the coming decades, therefore, the Netherlands will have to import more gas, including from Russia.
NL_M_025	6	There are drawbacks to these imports of oil and gas.
NL_M_025	7	Billions flow away from the Dutch economy ën we subsidize the military arming and spreading of intolerant views by Russia and Saudi Arabia.
NL_M_025	8	The adjustment to a sustainable economy does require sensible policies.
NL_M_025	9	It must remain affordable for ordinary families and business owners and there must always be electricity.
NL_M_025	10	Therefore, in addition to wind and solar power, nuclear power is needed.
NL_M_025	11	This is carbon-neutral and works even on days when the wind does not blow or the sun does not shine.
NL_M_025	12	It also prevents us from having to sacrifice the beautiful Dutch landscape to wind farms and solar fields.
NL_M_025	13	It is unwise for the Netherlands to set high ambitions on its own.
NL_M_025	14	Then we risk disadvantaging our entrepreneurs relative to neighboring countries and losing jobs.
NL_M_025	15	But we can't fall behind either.
NL_M_025	16	If we run away from sustainability, our innovative companies and research institutions will fall behind key technologies of the future.
NL_M_025	17	That too will cost jobs and prosperity in the long run, as well as being bad for the climate.
NL_M_025	18	Green and growth must go hand in hand.
NL_M_030	1	Volt wants to move toward an economy with a more equitable distribution of wealth.
NL_M_030	2	We ensure this by taxing top incomes above €201,000 per year more heavily and progressively.
NL_M_030	3	That means more high tax brackets, which means you will pay more the more you earn.
NL_M_030	4	In a socially equal Netherlands, the strongest shoulders carry the heaviest welds.
NL_M_030	5	The additional revenue will allow us to start paying for the great transitions of the 21st century.
NL_M_030	6	Volt wants to move toward an economy with a more equitable distribution of wealth.
NL_M_030	7	This requires that taxes become more progressive than they are now.
NL_M_030	8	Therefore, we propose four tax brackets.
NL_M_030	9	The first tax bracket is a negative income tax for the lowest earners, so they will have more net left over.
NL_M_030	10	The fourth tax bracket is for top incomes above €201,000 (this limit is linked to the Top Income Standardization Act).
NL_M_030	11	With the extra income from Box 2 and 3 in particular, we can start paying for the great transitions of the 21st century.
NL_M_030	12	Box 1 we reform so that the lowest earners will also reap the benefits of their hard work.
NL_M_030	13	Volt wants people to have equal opportunities in the job market and be fairly rewarded.
NL_M_030	14	The corona crisis has made it painfully clear that self-employed, temporary workers and those on zero-hours contracts are too financially dependent on precarious work.
NL_M_030	15	As a result, their income is also uncertain.
NL_M_030	16	In the current labor market, they often cannot find permanent employment, and this frequently leads to abuse of their weak position.
NL_M_030	17	Other aspects of the labor market also require improvement, such as wage levels and opportunities for retraining, child care and parental leave.
NL_M_030	18	Certainly youth unemployment in the Netherlands and Europe also requires extra attention.
NL_M_030	19	Nowadays, more and more people are on flex contracts (especially young people), leaving them with little social security.
NL_M_030	20	Contracts with flex workers are often cheap and easy for employers to terminate, which sometimes leads to abuse.
NL_M_030	21	Volt therefore wants to improve the position of flex workers.
NL_M_030	22	Volt wants to improve the legal status of self-employed workers, distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary self-employed workers.
NL_M_030	23	Combining different forms of work and contracts should be made easier for self-employed workers without losing social security benefits.
NL_M_030	24	This could be done, for example, by linking it to the person and not to the contract, thus creating a basis of social security for all.
NL_M_030	25	In this way, self-employed workers will have better mortgage options, access to safety nets for disability and unemployment, and more opportunities for retraining.
NL_M_030	26	In this way, those who choose to flex work are also protected, pay along and retain the freedom of flex work.
NL_M_030	27	The government's job is to create rules for this type of new social safety net that protect the self-employed.
NL_M_030	28	Here special attention is needed to elaborate and guarantee social securities for involuntary self-employed workers.

TR_005	2	"IZMIR In Izmir, Karsiyaka Chief Public Prosecutor's Office prepared an indictment against 12 suspects, including former Izmir Chief Public Prosecutor Durdu Kavak, prosecutor Zafer Kılınç and judge Atilla Rahman, on charges of ""abuse of office"" regarding the ""military espionage"" case, which resulted in the acquittal of 357 defendants, including military members on active duty."

TR_005	4	The indictment states that the suspects, operating on behalf of FETÖ, acted with the aim of discrediting some public officials, especially the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK).
TR_005	5	"The indictment states that former Izmir 12th Assize Court President Rahman and former member judges Öztürk and Kurt, who were sentenced to 9 years and 9 months in prison for ""being a member of an armed terrorist organization"", victimized the defendants by keeping them in detention for a long time, ""(It has been understood that the suspects) took actions that violated the honor and dignity of the profession and undermined the general respect and trust in the profession by taking actions contrary to the procedure and law during the investigation and prosecution process of the documents that were decided on the case known as the ""Izmir military espionage case"" in the public."
TR_005	6	""" the report concludes."
TR_005	7	"The indictment points out that former judge Ergül issued arrest warrants for 20 TAF personnel, including Kösele, without the knowledge of the judge on duty, even though he was not on duty, and that Ergül rejected the release requests of the suspects with ""repetitive templates""."
TR_005	8	"The indictment states that Zafer Kılınç accepted ""unlawful"" evidence seized during house and workplace searches as the basis for the investigation he initiated with an e-mail sent from the US, and that he issued an indictment without investigating suspicious issues such as ""the fact that the suspects were generally not at their residences during house searches where digital materials containing the Pandora database were found, and that the materials alleged to contain criminal elements were always found in black bags."""
TR_005	9	Background to the case.
TR_005	10	"In the investigation into the allegations of ""possession of classified military information and documents"", which was initiated following a denunciation e-mail sent to the Izmir Security Directorate on August 10, 2010, 357 defendants, including active duty soldiers and senior military officials, were accused of handing over classified state information and documents to foreign intelligence services."
TR_005	11	Izmir 5th High Criminal Court acquitted all defendants in February 2016.

TR_005	14	It was accepted by the High Criminal Court.
TR_005	15	The number of defendants in the case was first increased to 83 with the merger of the alleged conspiracy case against Mustafa Gülcü and Celal Uzunkaya, then deputy police chiefs, and then to 91 due to the merger of another case.

TR_007	1	Primary school starting age increases from 66 to 69 months
TR_007	2	Ankara.
TR_007	3	Minister of National Education Ziya Selçuk answered questions and made evaluations on the agenda at the Anadolu Agency (AA) Editorial Desk.
TR_007	4	"Asked whether kindergarten education will be included in the scope of compulsory education, Selçuk said, ""Making the age of 5 compulsory is something that we have included in the calendar after 3 years."
TR_007	5	If we decide this, how many classrooms do we need?
TR_007	6	How many teachers do you need?
TR_007	7	We have done a feasibility study on what the budgeting model of financing will be.
TR_007	8	It's a bit of a time thing.
TR_007	9	It is out of the question to close the need for so many classrooms all of a sudden, we have a commitment that we will do it in time, we will close it in time, we will make 5 years compulsory, we have a commitment that we will do it after 3 years.
TR_007	10	"Although it is also related to the general economic situation in Turkey, we see that we will make a great progress."""
TR_007	11	"Minister Selçuk stated that the Ministry is working with the Ministry of Family, Labor and Social Services and municipalities, taking into account the ages of 4 and 3, and said, ""We have prepared packages on how we can support the homes of those who have never been able to go to school in terms of pre-school packages, and the process is ongoing. We have a 69-month age limit."
TR_007	12	What we want to do here is that the 6-7 year old population has become intertwined. After 4+4+4, we have nearly 40 percent more children of the same age population.
TR_007	13	Next year will present us with a brand new picture of our classroom deficit in secondary education.
TR_007	14	"In order to avoid all this confusion, we will have already realized 69 months next year."""
TR_007	15	"""We need to get to know the child"" Selçuk responded to a question about the stage of the work to reduce the number of courses and the number of hours by saying: ""We see that the reduction of course types and hours is also related to the general trends in the world, in the Anglo-Saxon world there are 5-6 courses in high school and secondary education."
TR_007	16	We have 16-17 courses at the same age.
TR_007	17	It is not possible for a child to be exposed to so many lessons and internalize them in depth.
TR_007	18	While the whole world is doing this, when we look at what we can do, what we want to do is this; first we have to get to know a child.
TR_007	19	A child at the end of high school asks, 'What should I choose?
TR_007	20	I wonder what I'm good for.
TR_007	21	I wonder which department would be better for me?'
TR_007	22	if they have concerns, it shows that our guidance needs to be strengthened.
TR_007	23	We need to know the child.
TR_007	24	We have prepared a set especially for vocational education.
TR_007	25	"This set is a test that takes about 1.5 hours and shows which main or sub-branch of vocational education the child is suitable for."""
TR_007	26	"Stating that this test covers a wide range of skills and will help students to be better recognized, Minister Selçuk said, ""This is the main reason why we offer Turkish education at university level."
TR_007	27	"If children become more competent from the bottom up, these needs will be removed from the top."""
TR_007	28	"Selçuk said that any surplus that may arise in terms of norm staff will be a surplus on paper and added, ""It is out of the question that none of our teachers will remain idle."
TR_007	29	We have agreements with universities, and we will give sub-fields and certificates to our teachers.
TR_007	30	Practices such as double majors and minors exist in Turkey as they do all over the world.
TR_007	31	We met with YÖK and university rectors to offer such an opportunity to our teachers.
TR_007	32	"There is no such thing as our teachers being idle when we need more teachers."""
TR_008	1	'Parachute' follow-up of national skier by his father

TR_013	6	The parties, who had been arguing for a while, came face to face again in the garden of the site recently.
TR_013	7	When a friend of Oğuz E complained that he had been beaten, police teams arrived at the site.
TR_013	8	M.E. and Abdülkadir G., who are civilian police officers living in the same complex, allegedly acted in cooperation with the daily renters.

TR_019	1	Lots of imports but no reserves
TR_019	2	The foreign trade deficit increased by 69 percent to 50 billion dollars.
TR_019	3	For every $100 of imports, the country has only $23 in foreign exchange reserves.
TR_019	4	This was $45 in 2016 and $31.1 after the Pastor Brunson crisis in 2018.
TR_019	5	ECONOMIC SERVICE.
TR_019	6	With the publication of December foreign trade data by the Ministry of Trade, the balance sheet of 2020 was also revealed.
TR_019	7	According to the general trade system, the foreign trade deficit, which was 29.5 billion dollars in 2019, increased by 69 percent to 49.9 billion dollars in 2020. Exports in 2020 decreased by 6.3 percent compared to last year to 169.5 billion dollars, while imports increased by 4.32 percent to 219.4 billion dollars.
TR_019	8	Thus, while 86 units of exports were made for every 100 units of imports in 2019, exports corresponding to 100 units of imports became 77.3 units in 2020.
TR_019	9	China became Turkey's import champion When the import amounts by countries are analyzed, the increase in imports from China and Germany drew attention. China, which was the third country that Turkey imported the most in 2019, rose to first place in 2020.
TR_019	10	Imports from this country increased by 20.3 percent, from $19.1 billion to $23 billion.
TR_019	11	Russia, which was the top import destination last year, became the third top import destination in 2020 due to the decline in oil prices.
TR_019	12	Imports from Russia decreased by 22.6 percent to 17.9 billion dollars.
TR_019	13	Germany maintained its second place in this table and increased its exports to Turkey by 12.6 percent to 21.7 billion dollars.
TR_019	14	These three countries accounted for 29.8 percent of total imports. 23 units of reserves against 100 units of imports When the increase in the foreign trade deficit is compared with other financial indicators of the country, the picture becomes more striking.
TR_019	15	One of the most common ratios used by economists is the reserve/import ratio.
TR_019	16	With the release of 2020 data by the Ministry of Trade, it was possible to calculate how many units of foreign exchange reserves are available for every 100 units of imports.
TR_019	17	Accordingly, as of the end of December 2020, total imports amounted to $219.4 billion against $51.6 billion in foreign exchange reserves in the Central Bank's reserves, including swaps.
TR_019	18	In other words, by the end of 2020, for every 100 units of imports, there are 23.5 units of reserves. In 2019, this amount was 38.7, and after the Pastor Brunson crisis in 2018, it was 31.1. In 2016, the highest amount of 45.5 was recorded in the last 10 years.
TR_019	19	THE TOP COUNTRY HAS CHANGED.

TR_020	1	Erdoğan: Today you have a President who values his young people
TR_020	2	"""I wish the new academic year to be auspicious for our country."
TR_020	3	Arif Nihat Asya left indelible traces in our literary life with his poems that created storms in our hearts.
TR_020	4	As a patriotic teacher, Arif Nihat Asya raised thousands of students and taught them to be good people.
TR_020	5	We remember our poet with mercy once again.
TR_020	6	I believe that in this high school, which bears his name, we will have many values that will make unique contributions to the scientific, academic and artistic life of Turkey.
TR_020	7	The architects of a great and powerful Turkey will hopefully grow up in these classrooms.
TR_020	8	I wish each and every one of our children, whose eyes are shining brightly, to be good sons and daughters for their families and countries.
TR_020	9	On behalf of my country and nation, I would like to once again thank all of our education workers all over Turkey.
TR_020	10	On this occasion, I commemorate with mercy our martyred teachers like Necmettin and Aybüke Yalçın who were taken away from us at a young age by terrorist organizations.
TR_020	11	When we took office 20 years ago, we identified education as the first of the four pillars on which we would raise our country.
TR_020	12	We have never compromised on our priority of education. Every year, we allocated the largest share of the budget to education.
TR_020	13	We doubled the number of classrooms and solved the problem of crowded classrooms.
TR_020	14	We used to line up in front of stationery shops for a week, 10 days, to buy books and notebooks.
TR_020	15	Now we are also offering auxiliary resources free of charge to our students.
TR_020	16	We have made special efforts for the schooling of girls.
TR_020	17	The school enrollment rate for girls has reached 90 percent today.
TR_020	18	We are bringing village schools back to life with a more modern understanding.
TR_020	19	Since August, we have put more than 1000 Village Life Centers into operation, and hopefully we will increase this number to 1500 as soon as possible.
TR_020	20	We want a youth with knowledge, ideas and virtue, not a wandering youth with an empty mind and heart.
TR_020	21	We want to entrust our future to young people who are proud of their history, not those who look at their own state with hatred and anger.
TR_020	22	This is called the Teknofest generation.
TR_020	23	We have to raise our children with a strong sense of responsibility so that in the future we do not fall into the same crisis that the West is facing today, which cannot even find the population to sustain its own needs.
TR_020	24	I believe that we will raise the Teknofest generation in the best way possible with the support of our teachers, you and parents.
TR_020	25	Our civilization gives us all the motivation we need for the great leap ahead.
TR_020	26	You are the hope and tomorrow of our beautiful country.
TR_020	27	We are mobilizing all our means for each of you to take firm steps towards the future.
TR_020	28	Above all, for a strong future you need to learn your past well.
TR_020	29	Turkey is no longer a Turkey that sees its youth as a threat.
TR_020	30	Today you have a President, you have a state that values its youth.
TR_020	31	Please do not listen to the rootless people who try to make you forget your thousands of years of history, who try to make you curse your own ancestors.
TR_020	32	Be proud of your glorious history.
TR_020	33	Always be proud of your victories, your culture, your values that make us who we are.
TR_020	34	Respecting the elders and treating the little ones with compassion are the basic principles of our culture.
TR_020	35	No computer can replace a sweet conversation with your family members.
TR_020	36	Read, think, apply, conclude.
TR_020	37	The more you read, the more you will see the boundaries of your horizons expanding.

TR_031	8	The historical site, which made a great contribution to the tourism of the region with the completion of the second stage works to a great extent, was opened to visitors on July 28, 2020 with the participation of Minister of Culture and Tourism Mehmet Nuri Ersoy and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan connected via teleconference.
TR_031	9	THIRD CLOSING IN DECEMBER 2020.
TR_031	10	The monastery's gates were closed to visitors again in November 2020, pending the completion of the rest of the work.
TR_031	11	The monastery, protected by the 'bundling' system in which steel nets are laid on the hillside, was reopened to visitors on July 1, 2021 after the completed restoration works. CLOSED AGAIN ON NOVEMBER 1.
TR_031	12	During the restoration of the monastery, 10 chapels, bell tower, guesthouse, monk and student rooms, cellars and similar structures located to the right of the Mother Rock Church were unearthed.
TR_031	13	The monastery was closed to visitors on November 1, 2021 by the decision of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism as part of rock stabilization works.
TR_031	14	It was stated that the monastery, where the body of the rock mass on the slope above the entrance of the historical building will be permanently fixed with 16-meter steel piles, will be opened to visitors on January 31, 2022.
TR_031	15	Those who visit the monastery without knowing it is closed are forced to return.
TR_031	16	"'WE THOUGHT IT WAS OPEN' Abdülkadir Karaca, who came from Germany to see the monastery up close and was only able to see the historical structure from a distance, said, ""I feel bad that we couldn't see it."
TR_031	17	I was curious about the inside.
TR_031	18	It was unlucky, we didn't expect it to be like this.
TR_031	19	"We knew it was open,"" he said."
TR_031	20	"Nurettin Çakır, who stated that he was sorry that he could not visit the inside of the monastery, said, ""My guests had come."
TR_031	21	We wanted to take a monastery tour with them but it was not possible.
TR_031	22	They told us downstairs that the monastery was closed; we were really sad.
TR_031	23	The monastery was under renovation for a long time; we came but we couldn't see it.
TR_031	24	We are sad that it didn't end.
TR_031	25	"Inshallah, we will come to visit with our guests again in 3 months."""
TR_031	26	'KEEP OPEN AT CERTAIN HOURS' DEMAND.
TR_031	27	TÜRSAB Eastern Black Sea Regional Executive Board Member Ragıp Pirselimoğlu said that the closure of the monastery to visitors had a negative impact on tourism.
TR_031	28	"Suggesting that the historical site should remain open to visitors during limited hours, Pirselimoğlu said, ""The decision to close the monastery in the evening and close it in the morning without notice deeply affected travel agencies."
TR_031	29	A few years ago they did the same at Göbeklitepe.
TR_031	30	Upon the reaction of travel agencies and guides, they reopened the service for 3 hours a day.
TR_031	31	Our demand is not that it be closed all day, but that it continues to serve the tourism in the region.
TR_031	32	At least keep it open between 09.00 and 12.00.
TR_031	33	Tourism in the region had just started to revive.
TR_031	34	"We want to spend this dead season comfortably without being affected by this."""

TR_032	2	"Berkun Meral, Founder of IQUEEM, a digital and performance marketing agency, said, ""Even e-commerce, financial services and online services of government agencies can be imitated with fake websites and advertisements."
TR_032	3	"Many users who lack digital literacy or are distracted at that moment may not be able to distinguish fake sites and ads from the real ones."""
TR_032	4	attempts to make it a reality were also noteworthy.
TR_032	5	According to the report, travel-oriented digital fraud attempts increased by 110 percent in 2 years, while travel-oriented digital fraud cases with a total cost of 95 million dollars were reported in the US alone, according to data from the US Federal Trade Commission.
TR_032	6	"Berkun Meral pointed out that fake advertisements and websites are designed with elements such as discounts and vacation opportunities that consumers tend to be easily persuaded, ""In the past months, a domestic cyber security company in Turkey conducted a study in which 30 thousand people believed the 'free Maldives vacation' scenario."
TR_032	7	Users who click on these ads without realizing they are fake are exposed to risks such as theft of personal information, downloading malware, being scammed, and encountering dangerous and illegal content.
TR_032	8	As an agency that provides specialized services to the tourism industry and is ranked among the top 2,375 companies in the world according to Google, we encounter such cases frequently.
TR_032	9	"Cyber attackers are targeting comprehensive advertising networks such as Google and social media channels."""
TR_032	10	THEY ALSO FAKE CAR, BUNGALOV, BOAT RENTAL SITES Vacation bookings are not the only target of criminals seeking to commit rental fraud.
TR_032	11	"Stating that just a few days ago, a user shared that he was defrauded by a fake website that imitated a well-known car rental brand, Berkun Meral said, ""Again in the past months, a bungalow gang that defrauded 160 people was cracked."
TR_032	12	Any service that can be accessed over the internet can be a target for fraudsters.
TR_032	13	"It is necessary to be careful against these fake sites that draw a very professional image with the possibilities of design and web technologies and rank at the top with high-budget fake advertisements."""
TR_032	14	"""IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM FAKE ADS"""
TR_032	15	"Berkun Meral, Founder of IQUEEM, emphasized that the first precaution users should take before sharing their personal data or credit card information with a site is to check the link addresses of the sites: ""Using an up-to-date antivirus program is also a must for a safe internet experience."
TR_032	16	In addition, users should check whether the websites they suspect are the same as the address on the brand's Google Business card, be completely sure of the site before filling out the form, download from secure sources, confirm the accuracy of the websites they are directed to from social media, and if they are directed to a phone call through a holiday advertisement, they should definitely check the phone number they call from the business's website or Google Business card.
TR_032	17	"If internet browsers give a warning about a site, it is also important to take this warning into account and leave the site in order to stay safe."""
TR_035	1	"""Energy price cuts will have a positive impact on exports"""
TR_035	2	"Evaluating the March export figures, Saadettin Çağan, President of the Mediterranean Chemicals and Chemical Products Exporters' Association, said that the increasing high input costs in 2022 made sustainability in production difficult and stated the following: ""The biggest share of input costs is electricity and natural gas consumption."
TR_035	3	The reduction in these two items will support our competitiveness in global markets, especially against Far Eastern countries.
TR_035	4	Our biggest expectation is that this process will continue and energy prices will fall to reasonable levels.
TR_035	5	On the other hand, the low exchange rate level negatively affects our competitiveness in the international arena.
TR_035	6	We also have difficulties in accessing credit.
TR_035	7	"I would like to state that if these problems are eliminated, our export figures will increase even more."""
TR_035	8	"Fuat Tosyalı, President of the Mediterranean Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metals Exporters' Association (ADMIB), drew attention to the same issue: ""Since March last year, we have remained expensive compared to our competitors due to rising energy prices."
TR_035	9	However, as of April, the 20 percent discount on natural gas used in industry and the 15 percent discount on electricity will take effect.
TR_035	10	As of June, our country's industrialists will be more competitive in energy costs.

TR_039	4	As a result of the filiation studies, it was stated that the most important factor in the increase in the number of cases in the city was the gatherings formed in the houses and the non-compliance with the mask, distance and cleaning rules among the family.

TR_044	8	In other words, the bill for incompetence was again passed to the nation.
TR_044	9	"""These are lies,"" they replied."
TR_044	10	The state ministry, the state auditing agency calls you a liar.
TR_044	11	Here is what the Turkish state has been reduced to under the partisan presidential system.
TR_044	12	"President and AK Party Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was asked: ""Whom do you think these bureaucrats you appointed look up to?"""
TR_044	13	"""You are the inspiration of bureaucrats who are mired in waste and corruption,"" the IYI Party leader said."

TR_044	16	"Reminding that the Turkish Lira lost value with the interest rate cut, the IYI Party leader stated that CBRT Governor Şahap Kavcıoğlu is not responsible for these increases and said, ""Because he is no more than a bureaucrat whose expiration date is approaching in this system that grinds bureaucrats like garbage."
TR_044	17	"The main responsible for these costs is Mr. Erdogan himself, who imprisoned the Turkish State in a freak system, who sacrificed the Turkish economy to his irrational theories, and who is known to wash his hands of every incident."""
TR_044	18	"""I aspire to be Prime Minister"" statement."
TR_044	19	"In the last part of her speech, Akşener said, ""I am not a presidential candidate."
TR_044	20	"I aspire for the Prime Minister's Office"", he said the following: I said this and the market was confused."
TR_044	21	For a week now, there have been debates on TV about whether it will be like this or like that, whether he meant it that way.
TR_044	22	What I am saying is very clear.
TR_044	23	As the People's Alliance, we will nominate a presidential candidate and this candidate will be Turkey's 13th president.
TR_044	24	He will become President.
TR_044	25	But unlike the stakeholders of the People's Alliance, we will not elect a new Erdoğan.
TR_044	26	We know that even if the person we nominate is the most capable person in the world, Turkey cannot be governed with this freak system.
TR_044	27	Our problem is a system problem.
TR_044	28	The primary task of the candidate of the People's Alliance, who will be elected as the 13th President of Turkey, will be to rid Turkey of this outdated system and to implement a democracy based on the separation of powers.
TR_044	29	"Akşener continued, ""Yes, I do not aspire for the Presidency in this freak system."
TR_044	30	But I aspire to come out of the elections as the first party, and when we achieve this together, I aspire to be the first Prime Minister of an improved and strengthened parliamentary system.
TR_044	31	I aspire to re-establish the ties between the nation and the state, to strengthen Turkey and enrich our nation.
TR_044	32	I aspire to make Europe's poorest nation richer, to reverse the capital and brain drain.
TR_044	33	"I aspire to establish a legal order where freedoms are enjoyed to the fullest, where we will not doubt the justice, and to end corruption, theft and injustice."""
TR_044	34	"""Whoever runs instead of Erdoğan will get more votes, go and talk about it"" ""On this occasion, I would like to make a recommendation to the palace media,"" Akşener said: ""Instead of Mr. Erdoğan, who has rapidly impoverished Turkey in the last three and a half years, the People's Alliance urgently needs to find a much stronger candidate."
TR_044	35	So go and discuss the candidate of the People's Alliance.
TR_044	36	Go and talk about who will get more votes instead of Mr. Erdoğan.
TR_044	37	Discuss who would be able to close the gap with the National Alliance if they run instead of Mr. Erdoğan.

TR_047	4	President and AKP Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made the opening speech at the 29th Consultation and Evaluation Meeting of his party in Kızılcahamam.

TR_047	14	No one is obliged to vote for us.
TR_047	15	We will achieve this by winning the hearts of our people.
TR_047	16	That's what the gentleman instructed.
TR_047	17	It is said to have been requested.
TR_047	18	We don't know about it.
TR_047	19	We will not allow this opportunism.
TR_047	20	We need to raise the consciousness of membership to a very different level.
TR_047	21	We are obliged to make those who join the ranks of the AK Party partners in our great civilization cause.
TR_047	22	Do not let the foci of sedition discourage us.

TR_047	24	"""We have no thought, intention, plan or effort to reduce the election rate of the President from 50 percent to 40 percent."
TR_047	25	Those who make such references should look in the mirror.
TR_047	26	Once we put something on the record, that's the end of it.
TR_047	27	We will protect this so that no one in Turkey will ever again oppress the nation on the basis of a small minority.
TR_047	28	CHP is trying to make something out of this.
TR_047	29	You'll get nothing out of this.
TR_047	30	You don't have a bone in your body. 50+1 is the backbone of this system.

TR_077	2	President and AK Party Chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made statements at the AK Party Group Meeting in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
TR_077	3	President Erdoğan wished Hatay and Iskenderun a speedy recovery and said that two terrorists who entered Turkey from the Amanos Mountains the previous day to carry out an attack were detected in a short time thanks to the attention and ferocity of the security forces and a major disaster was prevented.
TR_077	4	"Evaluating Russia's attack on the training center of the Syrian National Army forces in Idlib region as a sign that permanent peace and tranquility is not desired in the region, President Erdoğan continued as follows: ""Likewise, it is clear that the structure that the US is trying to create along Syria's border with Iraq is a harbinger of new conflicts, pain and tragedy."
TR_077	5	The Syrian people are paying with their blood and lives for the strategic games of the regime and the terrorist organizations guided by forces from outside the region.
TR_077	6	We cannot stand by and watch this hypocrisy, this injustice, this injustice.
TR_077	7	Because we also feel the pain of every incident happening right next to our borders.
TR_077	8	The incident in Hatay is the most recent and concrete example of this.
TR_077	9	"The powers that have settled on Syrian soil but have not fought DAESH as much as we have, should put aside this middle game."""

TR_077	11	With our War of Independence, we disrupted the calculations of those who planned to divide our current lands piece by piece, to make our nation a prisoner in Anatolia and even to liquidate it completely.

TR_102	1	Decision Concerning Millions of Employees
TR_102	2	The Court of Cassation, which has issued a decision that closely concerns millions of private sector employees, ruled that it is not against the law to arrange another job before resigning.
TR_102	3	İ.K., who works in a private company in Bursa's İnegöl district, objected to the fact that while receiving a net salary of 2,500 TL, 1,750 TL was deposited into his bank account and the remaining part was given by hand.
TR_102	4	Claiming that it was unfair that his insurance premium was paid below his salary, İ.K. resigned through a notary public.
TR_102	5	İ.K., who went to the Labor Court, stated that his insurance premiums were underpaid over the part deposited in the bank, that he worked overtime and on public holidays, that he was not paid for his work and that he terminated his employment contract with just cause in accordance with Article 24/2/e of the Labor Law, and that the lawsuit was filed for the collection of labor receivables after the defendant failed to make any payment within the period specified in the notice.
TR_102	6	İnegöl Labor Court ruled for partial acceptance of the case, rejection of the severance pay claim, overtime wage with 15 percent fairness discount, national holiday and general holiday wage with 15 percent fairness discount.
TR_102	7	The court pointed out that the plaintiff, while working at the defendant's workplace, made preparatory procedures to be appointed to a public institution, and although he declared that he terminated his employment contract for just cause upon the finalization of the process regarding his appointment, the plaintiff could not be entitled to severance pay as it was fixed that his real will was the fact of working in another institution.
TR_102	8	THE SUPREME COURT STEPS IN.
TR_102	9	Both the plaintiff and the defendant's lawyer appealed the court's decision.
TR_102	10	Bursa Regional Court of Appeals 3rd
TR_102	11	The Civil Chamber decided to dismiss the appeal applications of the parties on the merits with finality.
TR_102	12	In the decision, it was concluded that the reasoning of 'It is understood that the reason for the termination of the plaintiff's employment contract in reality was to transfer to the civil service, and the rejection of the severance pay claim was found in accordance with the procedure and the law', and again, in the appeal examination regarding overtime work receivables, since the payrolls were signed, it was concluded that a judgment was established without examining the payrolls in detail.
TR_102	13	Bursa Regional Court of Appeals No. 9, which evaluated the appeal of another worker working in the same workplace.
TR_102	14	The Civil Chamber ruled that the workers did not act in bad faith.
TR_102	15	When the plaintiff worker appealed the decision, the Court of Cassation 9th
TR_102	16	The Civil Chamber entered.
TR_102	17	The Chamber, which signed a precedent-setting decision, pointed out that it was not malicious for the resigned worker to arrange another job.
TR_102	18	"The decision reads as follows: ""The fact that an employee, who claims that he has just cause for termination, has applied for another job before the termination, taking into account the unemployment process and living conditions after the possible termination date, and terminates his employment contract after the acceptance of this application, does not eliminate the fact of justified termination arising from the employer, nor does it result in the conclusion that this termination is in bad faith."
TR_102	19	Because here, the fact that the will to terminate is not expressed at the time of its birth, but afterwards, is due to humanitarian concerns that can be considered reasonable, and since there is no intention to harm the employer, it would not be appropriate to characterize it as an abuse of right.
TR_102	20	In short; the reasons that lead to justified termination are from the employer, and it is understood that the use of this right by the plaintiff workers before the start of the new job, as well as the use of this right after the job application was made and accepted before the termination, is due to reasonable humanitarian concerns.
TR_102	21	Since it would not be compatible with the principle of equity and justice to accept that this right has been exercised in violation of the rule of honesty, the dispute has been decided by the Bursa Regional Court of Appeals 9.
TR_102	22	"It has been decided to remedy the situation in line with the decision of the Civil Chamber."""
TR_108	1	Almost all people live in tent cities or container cities
TR_108	2	"""The relationship of Antakya, known as the ""Queen of the East"", which has a history of thousands of years and hosts different cultures and religions, with earthquakes is not an unknown process..."

TR_108	4	"Evaluations in the TMA report dated 21/04/2023: ""This report, which includes the health structure in the region, its sustainability, the problems identified and possible solutions, has also tried to reveal the victimization experienced by health personnel trying to provide health services."
TR_108	5	But the real problem is in the so-called unregulated tent cities, some of which have been set up by municipalities and voluntary organizations.
TR_108	6	In these settlements, where there is no ruling authority and where people of different ethnic origins live, hygiene is extremely poor, drinking and potable water is hard to find, and toilets are in very bad condition.
TR_108	7	Health care is almost non-existent.
TR_108	8	It is like a daily struggle for survival, where water is carried by tankers brought by the local municipality and hunger is tried to be satisfied with the food provided by the municipality, AFAD and volunteer organizations.
TR_108	9	There are people who don't want to leave their houses (heavily damaged, or don't dare to enter but need to take precautions against thieves, or are waiting for the authorities to come and report on their houses) and have set up their tents in their gardens or in any empty space they can find.
TR_108	10	There are irregular settlements where all basic needs such as water, food, toilets, bathrooms and hygiene are met by the people themselves because AFAD has shown them a place but has not gone there.
TR_108	11	These tent settlements, scattered in clusters across the city, are completely abandoned to their fate.
TR_108	12	The number of health workers killed in the Hatay earthquake was reported to be around 220, including 100 physicians (source is an authorized person but unofficial figures).
TR_108	13	The number of deceased physicians was announced by the Hatay Medical Chamber as 65 people whose names could be identified.
TR_108	14	A physician was said to be missing.
TR_108	15	Therefore, in ASMs where services are available, physicians of the region come together and try to carry out services in shifts.
TR_108	16	However, since most of the patient information is in the computer system and there is no internet infrastructure, it is difficult for them to run efficiently.
TR_108	17	They have difficulty accessing MERNIS.
TR_108	18	Since many of them lost their e-signature dungle, issuing and activating a new one was a problem.
TR_108	19	In the MERNIS system, many ASM physicians remain uncertain about the number of their population, the status of pregnant women, the number of children and infants, and the latest vaccination status.
TR_108	20	There is total chaos, unfortunately.
TR_108	21	Whichever tent settlement you go to, they complain about these problems.
TR_108	22	Lice and scabies outbreaks and gastroenteritis are common, especially in irregular settlements.
TR_108	23	It is inevitable that these diseases will become more common with the increase in summer temperatures.
TR_108	24	Chronic patients, on the other hand, can find palliative solutions to their problems with the help of their relatives or voluntary organizations such as the TMA.
TR_108	25	Although AFAD camps are relatively organized, primary health care is provided by mobile health teams that come 1-2 times a week for a few hours.
TR_108	26	Emergency cases are transported to the nearest field hospital (if a vehicle is available).
TR_108	27	Waste disposal, garbage collection is a big problem.
TR_108	28	Sewers are inadequate, in some areas they flow openly, in others the septic tanks are overflowing.

TR_118	1	12 Article Circular from the Ministry of Health
TR_118	2	According to a circular issued by the Ministry of Health, all private and foundation hospitals have been declared pandemic hospitals.
TR_118	3	In the 12-article circular published by the Ministry of Health, the measures to be taken by hospital administrations were explained.
TR_118	4	The circular sent to hospitals from the Ministry is as follows; Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which emerged in the People's Republic of China and has been reported from various countries, poses a public health threat for the whole world and is closely monitored by our Ministry.
TR_118	5	Necessary measures are taken in our country, taking into account the recommendations of the World Health Organization.
TR_118	6	In order to prevent the spread of the disease in our country, the Scientific Committee meets regularly and makes evaluations on the subject.
TR_118	7	Although measures have been taken in many areas, it is necessary to take the following measures in all health service providers in order to minimize the intensity in health institutions and to reduce the burden on our health personnel: 1.
TR_118	8	Patients who apply to health institutions must be admitted and treated by the Ministry of Health hospitals, State and Foundation University hospitals and all private health institutions until the diagnosis of COVID-19 is finalized. 2.
TR_118	9	Hospitals with at least two physicians specialized in Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Pulmonary Diseases, Internal Diseases and hospitals with level 3 adult intensive care beds are considered as Pandemic Hospital**.
TR_118	10	*During the pandemic, Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Internal Diseases or Pulmonary Diseases Specialist can be recruited from another hospital.
TR_118	11	**Pandemic Hospital: It is defined as the hospital where the treatment process of COVID-19 diagnosed (test positive) cases is carried out. 3.
TR_118	12	A Pandemic General Coordination Team should be established within the hospital according to the Pandemic Action Plan prepared by the General Directorate of Public Health. 4.
TR_118	13	In pandemic hospitals, a clinic and an intensive care unit dedicated to pandemic patients should be identified and reserved for these cases.
TR_118	14	In case of an increase in the number of cases, the order in which other intensive care units and wards will be separated should be determined.
TR_118	15	Beds in oncology-hematology and radiation oncology clinics, organ transplantation clinics and bone marrow transplantation centers, where patients whose treatment has started and needs to continue, will continue to be used normally as much as possible. 5.
TR_118	16	In pandemic hospitals, it should be determined in which wards and intensive care units patients other than patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be monitored. 6.
TR_118	17	In places where pandemic hospitals are insufficient, hospitals with 2nd step adult intensive care units should be organized to serve as pandemic hospitals. 7.
TR_118	18	The route to the clinics and intensive care beds reserved for pandemic patients is determined and necessary measures are taken on this route. 8.
TR_118	19	In pandemic hospitals, the names and titles of the personnel who will work in clinics, operating rooms and delivery rooms are determined in shifts. 9.
TR_118	20	In pandemic hospitals, 1 operating room where surgical interventions of COVID-19 infected cases can be performed and 1 delivery room where infected pregnant women can give birth in hospitals with gynecology and obstetrics clinics should be determined and kept as reserved. 10.
TR_118	21	The chief physician/executive director of the pandemic hospital is fully authorized to use clinical beds, intensive care units, operating rooms and to assign personnel so as not to disrupt normal functioning. 11.
TR_118	22	Provincial Health Directors are fully authorized to relocate the necessary personnel in all health facilities within the province. 12.
TR_118	23	Provincial/district hospitals that do not have a pandemic hospital where patients diagnosed with COVID-19 apply should refer these patients to the hospital specified in the referral algorithm by taking the necessary measures.
TR_118	24	The transfer of patients is coordinated by 112 Command and Control Centers within or outside the province.
TR_128	1	Member of the Scientific Committee Prof. Dr.
TR_128	2	Yavuz: It is too early to talk about full opening up Prof. Yavuz Yavuz, Member of the Coronavirus Scientific Committee of the Ministry of Health and Faculty Member of the Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine.
TR_128	3	Dr.
TR_128	4	Serap Şimşek Yavuz drew attention to the increase in cases in Istanbul and made important warnings.
TR_128	5	Emphasizing that big cities like Istanbul should be evaluated in a different position in decentralization decisions.
TR_128	6	Dr.
TR_128	7	"Yavuz explained the reason for this as follows: ""Istanbul is really in a different situation both in terms of work flow and population mobility."
TR_128	8	It is a province with a lot of mobility between districts.
TR_128	9	Therefore, decisions should be taken on a provincial basis in Istanbul.
TR_128	10	The provincial pandemic committee can also determine the infection rates from district to district, but since there is a lot of transition in this way, it would be healthier to evaluate on a provincial basis.
TR_128	11	"In small places, maybe provincial pandemic committees may decide to open due to a very low infection rate in a village or close due to very high rates in a village, but Istanbul really needs to be evaluated differently than other provinces in this sense."""
TR_128	12	"""TEST POSITIVITY RATES ARE INCREASING"" Pointing out that the rates in Istanbul are on an upward trend compared to the previous week, Prof. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. İsmail Demir stated that the rates in Istanbul are on an upward trend compared to the previous week."
TR_128	13	Dr.
TR_128	14	"Serap Şimşek Yavuz stated that it is still early for a ""full opening"" and continued his words as follows: ""There is an increase compared to the previous week."
TR_128	15	In our own hospital or when we talk to our friends, we can say that there has been a slight movement both in terms of test positivity rates and the number of cases.
TR_128	16	This reminds us once again that we need to be on high alert.
TR_128	17	The downward trend I just mentioned needs to be seen and sustained.
TR_128	18	At the moment, this is not the case yet, in fact, it is going up a little bit, both in terms of test positivity and the number of cases.
TR_128	19	Although there is no shortage of capacity in hospitals and no overcrowding in intensive care capacity, which are also important criteria in opening decisions, it is a good thing that the number of seriously ill patients is not too high, but the upward trend in test positivity rates and the number of cases makes us think.
TR_128	20	"I think it's a bit early for Istanbul to be fully open."""
TR_128	21	"""I HOPE THAT THE INCREASE IS NOT MUTANT-RELATED"" Referring to the risk that the upward trend in Istanbul may be due to the mutant strain, Prof. Dr. Dr. Dr. İsmail Demir also mentioned that there is a risk that the increase in the number of cases in Istanbul may be related to the mutant strain."
TR_128	22	Dr.
TR_128	23	"Yavuz said, ""We hope that the reason for this increase is not the mutant strain."
TR_128	24	Because then we will not be able to slow down under these measures and we may have to increase the measures.
TR_128	25	But we know that the mutant strain, especially V1 (the UK variant), is also spreading in Turkey.
TR_128	26	"Therefore, it is very useful to be cautious."""
TR_128	27	"""CHILDREN'S LACK OF EDUCATION HAS BECOME MORE DANGEROUS THAN COVID"" Commenting on the opening of the schools, Prof. Dr. Dr. Dr. İsmail Demir also made evaluations on the opening of the schools."
TR_128	28	Dr.
TR_128	29	"Yavuz said, ""Even if certain thresholds are lowered, attention should be paid to the measures to be taken when schools open."
TR_128	30	Families should pay attention to their children's use of masks.
TR_128	31	Families should also monitor whether such measures are taken, such as overcrowded classrooms, students going on certain days, and so on.
TR_128	32	Children really need to go back to education.
TR_128	33	It has become a very big priority.
TR_128	34	Because their lack of education has become greater than the dangers posed by Kovid.
TR_128	35	Therefore, education should be prioritized everywhere.
TR_128	36	However, children should never be sent to school when they are sick.
TR_128	37	"Because although children are not actually affected by the disease, it creates a risk in terms of the spread of the disease."""

TR_140	1	Why did the Kazakhs take to the streets?
TR_140	2	South Caucasus expert Stefan Meister explains the reasons for the political turmoil in the post-Soviet region and what it means for Russia - Deutsche Welle: Mr. Stefan Meister, how do you assess the events in Kazakhstan?
TR_140	3	Stefan Meister: These are the strongest protests we have seen in Kazakhstan for years.
TR_140	4	It is affecting a large part of the country, not just a specific region.
TR_140	5	People are angry.
TR_140	6	People have accumulated a lot.
TR_140	7	Rising gas and energy prices were a trigger for the disappointment.
TR_140	8	The ruling elites seem surprised by the scope and intensity of the protests and seem to be at a loss as to how to act. - So what do you think are the causes of the conflict?
TR_140	9	Despite the resignation of former President Nursultan Nazarbayev, there has been no fundamental change, and the power structure is still dominated by the old elites.
TR_140	10	On the other hand, there have been price increases in the country due to Covid and the pandemic.
TR_140	11	Socio-economic pressure on the population has increased, while unpaid salaries and poor working conditions have fueled dissatisfaction.
TR_140	12	People were suffering a loss of income and there was no hope for change
TR_140	13	.
TR_140	14	- The Cossacks look angry.
TR_140	15	Belarusians also took to the streets in anger against their rulers.
TR_140	16	Can you compare the situation in these two countries?
TR_140	17	The Lukashenko regime in Belarus is even more authoritarian and less willing to reform, especially when it comes to economic policy.
TR_140	18	Little has changed in Belarus in the last 30 years.
TR_140	19	Kazakhstan has a very liberal economy and has allowed many Chinese investors to enter the country.
TR_140	20	But Kazakhs feel that they are not getting a share of the wealth and development that has been fueled by investment. - The transition of the presidency in 2019 from Nursultan Nazarbayev to Jomar Tokayev was seen as a successful transition of power.
TR_140	21	Is that true?
TR_140	22	Nazarbayev remains in a key position and ultimately decides the fate of the country.
TR_140	23	Decisive positions in the state apparatus and in the Security Council are still linked to him.
TR_140	24	In this context, it was in fact half a change of power and there was no public participation.
TR_140	25	"The demonstrators' slogan ""The old man must go"" also shows that they want a change in the political elite"
TR_140	26	.
TR_140	27	- And how do you think the Kremlin is looking at Kazakhstan now?
TR_140	28	What are the Kremlin's concerns?
TR_140	29	The most important thing for the Kremlin is stability and maintaining its sphere of influence.
TR_140	30	Developments in Belarus are now consolidating for the Kremlin, but of course they are still far from stable.
TR_140	31	People are increasingly against the regime and Russia.
TR_140	32	Kazakhstan is Russia's second most important ally in the region after Belarus.
TR_140	33	Kazakhstan is surrounded by difficult countries like Afghanistan.
TR_140	34	For the Kremlin, which fears another colorful revolution in the region, this is also a security issue.
TR_140	35	The Kremlin will pay close attention to what happens there.
TR_140	36	As long as he can, he will support the regime to stay in power.

TR_145	1	CHP demands annulment of 11 articles in 'Digital Service Tax Law'
TR_145	2	Nursima ÖZONUR-Gökhan CEYLAN/ANKARA, (DHA)- CHP Group Deputy Chairman Engin Altay applied to the Constitutional Court for the annulment of 11 articles of the Law No. 7194 on Digital Service Tax and Amendments to Certain Laws and Decree Law No. 375, including provisions on 'valuable housing tax' and 'accommodation tax'.
TR_145	3	CHP Group Deputy Chairman Engin Altay made a statement to press members after submitting an application to the Constitutional Court.
TR_145	4	"Regarding Article 7 of the Digital Service Tax Law, which they demanded to be annulled, Altay said, ""This law regulates that the Ministry of Treasury and Finance will decide to block access to the services provided by digital service providers who do not fulfill their Digital Service Tax obligations until these obligations are fulfilled."
TR_145	5	This regulation is in the nature of a regulation that will create a legal basis for new censorship practices.
TR_145	6	We demanded its annulment as it is in clear violation of the relevant articles of the Constitution.
TR_145	7	While the Constitution stipulates that these freedoms can only be restricted by judicial decision in limited cases, the regulation in question authorizes censorship on the grounds of a financial issue.
TR_145	8	"There is no censorship in real democracies,"" he said."
TR_145	9	"'MUNICIPALITIES ON THE COASTS ARE BEING PUNISHED' Engin Altay also said about the 'accommodation tax' regulation that they want to be canceled: ""This regulation envisages a 2 percent accommodation tax and stipulates that this new accommodation tax will be collected by the central government, not by local governments."
TR_145	10	With the regulation requested to be annulled, the AKP transfers resources to the central government, while placing the burden of service on municipalities.
TR_145	11	It is almost as if the municipalities on the coasts are being penalized and are being asked to move to a point where they cannot provide services.
TR_145	12	"For these reasons, it is requested that this regulation, which is contrary to Articles 127 and 90 of the Constitution, be annulled."""
TR_145	13	"Engin Altay stated that they also demanded the annulment of the provisions regarding the 'Valuable Housing Tax' and said: ""Article 73 of the Constitution stipulates that 'Everyone is obliged to pay taxes according to their financial capacity to meet public expenses'."
TR_145	14	The regulation also does not include provisions that would prevent the collection of taxes from those who cannot afford to pay.
TR_145	15	In other words, it is envisaged that even a pensioner with only one roof over his head will be taxed.
TR_145	16	Since the obligation to pay taxes is not determined according to 'financial ability', these regulations are contrary to Article 73 of the Constitution.
TR_145	17	Another unconstitutional provision is 'In shared ownership and joint ownership, the calculation of the tax base is based on the total value of the residential immovable property'.
TR_145	18	This provision is also contrary to Article 73 of the Constitution.
TR_145	19	While the real estate tax is collected by local governments, the valuable housing tax is envisaged to be collected by the central government.
TR_145	20	"This situation is contrary to Article 127 of the Constitution, which states that local governments should have revenues commensurate with their duties, and the European Charter of Local Self-Government, which also includes the same principle, and therefore its annulment is requested."""
TR_145	21	"'THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IS VIOLATED' Engin Altay stated that a regulation was made regarding the companies that collected money from citizens living abroad in the 1990s with the promise of high income through various methods and then caused the victimization of these citizens and said: ""It has been admitted that the lawsuits filed with the regulation are terminated through the law and it is prevented from making a decision on the demands of the people who filed a lawsuit."
TR_145	22	In other words, the right to a fair trial is blatantly violated.
TR_145	23	The said regulation has been requested to be annulled as it is contrary to Articles 2, 10, 13, 35, 36 and 138 of the Constitution.
TR_145	24	The provision regarding the exemption of the General Directorate of the State Supply Office from the Public Procurement Law in the purchase of vehicles, vehicle leasing, fuel purchases and the purchase of medicines, medical supplies and medical devices to be realized on behalf of administrations was also requested to be annulled as it is contrary to Articles 2, 7 and 48 of the Constitution.
TR_145	25	"Therefore, both regulations, which provide for exemptions from the public procurement law, have been requested to be annulled as they undermine the principles of public interest and transparency."""

TR_173	7	"Stressing that Turkey has a long tradition of elections, Kaymakcı said that observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), of which Turkey is a member, and the Council of Europe were invited to the May 14 elections, and continued as follows ""Following our invitation, the election observation mission of 14 international experts from the OSCE started its work on March 29. 28 long-term observers were deployed across the country as of April 7."
TR_173	8	In addition, 350 short-term observers will be deployed.
TR_173	9	In addition, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are also preparing to send election observation missions.
TR_173	10	"These delegations will work in Turkey as before."""
TR_173	11	"Reminding Sergey Lagodinsky's assessment that ""Turkey is the only candidate country to which the EP cannot send election observers"", Kaymakcı said, ""There is a reason for this."
TR_173	12	Turkey is the only candidate country not treated fairly by the EU.
TR_173	13	This will be assessed when the European Parliament and EU institutions start treating Turkey fairly.
TR_173	14	We have witnessed some bad examples in the past.
TR_173	15	Some parliamentarians from the OSCE and the EP went to Turkey not to observe the elections but to campaign.
TR_173	16	This caused problems.
TR_173	17	"We hope that such incidents will not happen again."""
TR_173	18	Kaymakcı emphasized that in the incident he mentioned, a German MP participated in an election campaign with the symbols of the PKK, which is also considered a terrorist organization by the EU, and that this is unacceptable.
TR_173	19	EARTHQUAKE SOLIDARITY IS EXPECTED TO BE REFLECTED IN THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD.
TR_173	20	Kaymakcı also expressed his gratitude for the support provided by the EU and member states following the earthquakes in Turkey on February 6, centered in Kahramanmaraş.
TR_173	21	Stating that the last planned meeting of the Turkey-EU Joint Parliamentary Commission could not be held due to the earthquake, Kaymakcı expressed his hope that the meeting of the commission would be held as soon as possible after the elections.
TR_173	22	Referring to Turkey-EU relations, Kaymakcı stated that the solidarity shown in the aftermath of the earthquake is expected to be reflected in the relations after the elections, and that improving relations with the EU is included in the election manifestos and discourses of almost all the parties participating in the elections.
TR_173	23	"Noting that the period when the EU accession perspective was presented to Turkey was the brightest period of the relations, Kaymakcı said that this was later damaged for various reasons and added: ""The accession perspective and process are key for Turkey-EU relations to go further."""
TR_173	24	"Referring to the war in Ukraine, Kaymakcı said, ""This war has shown that Turkey and the EU should work very closely on common defense and security policy, economic recovery, energy security and migration management."""
TR_173	25	Kaymakcı also emphasized that Turkey and the EU should work together in areas such as climate, recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and connectivity.

TR_180	1	Farewell words from Taha Akgül to wrestling!
TR_180	2	He gave a date...
TR_180	3	"National wrestler Taha Akgül, who became the world champion by defeating his Mongolian rival Lkhagvagerel Munkhtur 6-2 in the freestyle 125 kg final at the Senior World Wrestling Championships in Belgrade, Serbia, made statements to the press members. Stating that in 2017 and 2019 he lost to his Georgian opponent in the final in the last seconds and that he could have 5 championships now, Akgül said, ""It was not meant to be. In 2017 and 2019, I lost two finals in a very dramatic way. I could have fit two more world championships in 7 years, but the Creator always has a discretion."
TR_180	4	In fact, after being world champion, I also became Olympic champion. I reached the top of the world in 2014, 2015 and 2016 in a row.
TR_180	5	After that, I was always the champion in Europe, I beat good rivals, archrivals.
TR_180	6	I beat my Georgian opponent in the European championships, I always lost the match in the last seconds in the world championships. In 2017 and 2019, I lost a match when I was ahead with 5 seconds left.
TR_180	7	In this way, I lost two world championships, in fact I could have had 5 championships, but thank God I am in 2022, I am 32 years old.
TR_180	8	I won the world championship medal for the 3rd time by winning overwhelmingly against all my opponents.
TR_180	9	It's really maybe one of the most valuable world championships for me. 2014 was my first medal, that was precious, and in 2015 I became the champion in Las Vegas by beating all my opponents 10-0, that was also very special for me.
TR_180	10	"Since this 3rd one came after 7 years, it has a special place because I showed my strength to the whole world again."""
TR_180	11	"""TODAY I WILL SLEEP WITH MY GOLD BELT"" The world champion national wrestler showed his golden belt and said that he would sleep with it today."
TR_180	12	"The national wrestler said, ""I really wanted to get the golden belt again."
TR_180	13	And I think I deserve it.
TR_180	14	I worked, I put in the effort and I prepared really well.
TR_180	15	"Since I was well prepared, the Almighty has favored me and I became the champion in a comfortable way by establishing superiority over my rivals."""
TR_180	16	"""I AM A PEOPLE WHO CONTINUES TO Pursue CHAMPIONSHIPS WITHOUT STOPPING WORKING"" Speaking about the future, Taha Akgül said, ""The World Wrestling Union has made a headline about the Olympics: ""The old king is back."
TR_180	17	As I said before, I've always wrestled at the top, but I was missing the wins by the skin of my teeth, and this time I broke that bad luck and reached the golden belt.
TR_180	18	There's nothing left for the Olympics. In 1.5 years the Olympics are coming.
TR_180	19	In fact, qualifications start next year.
TR_180	20	The world championship next year is more important.
TR_180	21	"I am a person who continues to pursue championships without stopping working."""
TR_180	22	"""Stating that he has a wedding in a week and will present the belt to his fiancée, Akgül said, ""I have a wedding now, I will get married in a week, God willing."
TR_180	23	From here, I will take the gift of real gold to my fiancée and put it around her neck.
TR_180	24	I dedicate it to him.
TR_180	25	I spoke to him, he watched it with his family.
TR_180	26	He always told me 'you will be the first'.
TR_180	27	I won 3 gold medals with him.
TR_180	28	My wedding's in a week, I'm dedicating it to her.
TR_180	29	We are expecting all our loved ones at my wedding.
TR_180	30	It was a double wedding for me.
TR_180	31	"I hope we will celebrate both the world championship and our wedding together."""
TR_180	32	"""I WANT TO END MY WRESTLING CAREER AT THE TOP, AS OLYMPIC CHAMPION"" Pointing out that wrestling is a heavy and performance sport, the successful wrestler said, ""I work hard to be successful."
TR_180	33	We are constantly dealing with injuries, we are in constant contact with our opponents because it is a performance sport.
TR_180	34	That's why we are having a hard time.
TR_180	35	Hopefully, after the 2024 Paris Olympics, I want to end my wrestling career at the top, as an Olympic champion.
TR_180	36	And I'm 34 years old.
TR_180	37	After that, I have even bigger goals.
TR_180	38	Once that's over, I'll move on.
TR_180	39	I'll see what happens after that.
TR_180	40	I will shape my career accordingly, but I want to leave at the top.
TR_180	41	I have a final match today.
TR_180	42	I am not underestimating my Mongolian opponent, but he was an opponent I have beaten before.
TR_180	43	I was so stressed that I got tired in the match because of that stress.
TR_180	44	I was tired from the previous day.
TR_180	45	I also congratulated my opponent very much.
TR_180	46	He always wanted to come to the bilateral camp but unfortunately we couldn't make it happen. We had official correspondence for 4 months but unfortunately we didn't have a bilateral camp.
TR_180	47	He told me this all the time.
TR_180	48	So I told him about some of the problems.
TR_180	49	I'm sorry about that too.
TR_180	50	God willing, I will welcome him at my club.
TR_180	51	I will train with my club.
TR_180	52	"They especially want to work with me,"" he said."
TR_180	53	"""When reminded of the belt move he made after defeating his Iranian opponent in the semifinal, Akgül said, ""It is not my style."
TR_180	54	We have been in a rivalry with the Georgian athlete for years.
TR_180	55	In the last Olympics, he and I both lost to the US athlete.
TR_180	56	But I wanted him to win.
TR_180	57	We really congratulated each other after the competitions we won.
TR_180	58	We finished our matches with respect and love.
TR_180	59	We did not act outrageously.
TR_180	60	We did it in fair-play.
TR_180	61	He came before the match and said, 'I want you to win.
TR_180	62	Iranian athlete, we are also champions at the World Championships in Oslo in 2021, I have never done such a king move, crown move. I think he showed the wrong attitude in 2021.
TR_180	63	I did it as an answer to him. I didn't go to the 2021 World Championships ready.
TR_180	64	I got off vacation, I went to Oslo.
TR_180	65	This was his rematch.
TR_180	66	I'm very well prepared.
TR_180	67	I knew it was my final match.
TR_180	68	Because I did it with last year's world champion and the favorite.
TR_180	69	The fact that it came in the last seconds made me even more happy.
TR_180	70	Because it was a tough competition.
TR_180	71	I wanted to give such an answer.
TR_180	72	I had planned this.
TR_180	73	He didn't like what he did to her, so I did it to him.
TR_180	74	"Actually, it is not my style either,"" he said."
TR_191	1	31 kinds of products in 34 years old ice cream shop in Foça
TR_191	2	31 kinds of products in a 34-year-old ice cream shop in Foça.
TR_191	3	Nazmi Altıntaş, who is famous for his ice cream made with classical methods in Foça, the touristic district of İZMİR, is trying to melt the 'queue in front of his shop', as he calls it, in his 34th year.
TR_191	4	"At the door of his place, which is open 365 days a year, Master Nazmi welcomes his customers, who are queuing up at the door again these days, with the warnings ""Wear your mask, keep your social distance""."
TR_191	5	Cretan Chios Ice Cream Shop, which has been serving on the coast of Foça for 34 years, run by 59-year-old Nazmi Altıntaş, who is the child of an Albanian family who originally immigrated to Turkey from Macedonia, is flooded with customers.
TR_191	6	Vacationers who prefer Foça for their holidays do not leave without eating ice cream from Nazmi master who makes 31 kinds of ice cream from fresh fruits he uses according to the season.
TR_191	7	Nazmi usta appeals to every palate with his pistachio, almond, fig, cake, walnut, cookies, caramel, cappuccino, blue sky, cocoa, croquant, gum, chocolate, vanilla, mint, borovinka, strawberry, black mulberry, apricot, melon, kiwi, yogurt, lemon, banana, fruit cocktail, blackberry, raspberry, sour cherry, fruit yogurt, pumpkin and tahini ice creams.
TR_191	8	Those who come to Foça do not pass without tasting these flavors.
TR_191	9	"'I would make 80 kinds of ice cream if there was room' Master Nazmi, who says ""I would make 80 kinds of ice cream if there was room"", is preparing to open his second branch in the stone building, which is a restored old Greek house."
TR_191	10	"Stating that even the heart attack he had at his counter last year could not stop him from working, Altıntaş said, ""I have contributed a lot to ice cream and ice cream has contributed a lot to me."
TR_191	11	Ice cream saved my life and the paramedic in the ice cream line saved my life when I had a heart attack.
TR_191	12	"If ice cream is involved, production continues."""
TR_191	13	"'NOW IS THE TIME FOR PUMPKINS, NOW IS THE TIME FOR FRUIT' Nazmi Altıntaş explained the care he showed in the production and the interest that has been going on for years with the following words: ""I do everything measured to the gram."
TR_191	14	The flavor is always the same. Those who ate my ice cream 5 years ago will find the same flavor 5 years later.
TR_191	15	I always use natural milk, salep, sugar, chewing gum and various fruits.
TR_191	16	Nothing bad can enter this shop because it's cheap.
TR_191	17	I do everything myself.
TR_191	18	I also have the support of my master, whom I have trained for the last year.
TR_191	19	I taught him quality first.
TR_191	20	I use fresh fruit and milk.
TR_191	21	No cost cutting, no compromise on quality.
TR_191	22	We do not use dyes or additives.
TR_191	23	We even yellow lemons with oranges.
TR_191	24	The orange gives the lemon its color.
TR_191	25	If there is no orange, the ice cream will not turn yellow even if you put the lemon itself.
TR_191	26	Although we do things the old-fashioned way, we also use small technological tools to make things easier.
TR_191	27	Like a mixer, a cooler.
TR_191	28	Now it's time for zucchini and peaches.
TR_191	29	The fiber-free structure of chestnut squash is ideal for ice cream.
TR_191	30	"If we don't use these vegetables and fruits now, when will we use them?"""
TR_191	31	"Hasan Doğan, one of Nazmi master's customers, stated that such places should be kept alive and said, ""I really like the flavor of the ice cream varieties here."
TR_191	32	Sometimes I come to Foça just to eat tahini ice cream.
TR_191	33	"Our country needs values like master Nazmi."""
TR_191	34	"Cansu Akın said, ""When we come to Foça, the first thing that comes to our mind is to eat ice cream here."
TR_191	35	It's delicious.
TR_191	36	"We recommend it to everyone,"" he said."
TR_191	37	"Hülya Kelleli, who came to Foça on vacation from Turgutlu district of Manisa, said, ""This is my fourth time in Foça."
TR_191	38	We love it here.
TR_191	39	"Every time we come, we enjoy the ice cream of master Nazmi."""

TR_208	6	Pierre told Aziz that Dilruba had married Adem to save him.
TR_208	7	The 17th episode of Aziz, which aired last night, witnessed exciting developments.
TR_208	8	Efnan's day in court has come.
TR_208	9	Aziz surprised everyone and wanted to defend Efnan himself.
TR_208	10	Knowing that it was his right as her husband to do so, Aziz announced that their religious marriage had been solemnized.
TR_208	11	Aziz said that according to the rules, there could be no retrial for a crime for which the penalty had been imposed, while Mother Hatice was shouting in front of the journalists that her son Zülfikar had been hanged for no crime.
TR_208	12	Pierre began to tremble with fear that if Efnan was found guilty, it would be publicized that he had extrajudicially executed a disabled Turkish teenager.
TR_208	13	In a courtroom where the voices of justice echoed, the judge made his decision and dismissed the case.
TR_208	14	Amid cries of joy, Efnan and Aziz hugged each other tightly.

TR_208	16	But Pierre, unable to accept defeat, had one more move.
TR_208	17	Pierre, who was trying to separate Efnan from Aziz and found out that they were married, was devastated but played his last trump card and told Aziz that Dilruba had married Adem to save him from punishment.
TR_208	18	Aziz was shocked to learn the truth.
TR_208	19	So, what was Aziz going to do in the face of this truth?
TR_208	20	Aziz is learning the big truth;
TR_208	21	SOCIAL MEDIA SAID #LOVESURMEZ!

TR_208	27	Rushing to Efnan, who had been arrested and brought to the administration building, Aziz wanted to save the woman he loved from this unrelenting predicament.
TR_208	28	As a tearful Efnan was taken away, Pierre, who wanted to rip out Aziz's heart, watched them with an icy face.
TR_208	29	Enraged, Aziz was looking for ways to reach Efnan, while Pierre was pressuring Efnan to confess to Andre's murder.
TR_208	30	Efnan was willing to be arrested if he didn't turn Aziz in.
TR_208	31	"""I told you I'd hit you where it hurts, Aziz Payidar!"""
TR_208	32	AZIZ TRIED EVERY WAY TO SEE EFNAN.
TR_208	33	During all these events, there was a shocking development between Dilruba and Adem.
TR_208	34	Claiming that Dilruba was happy that Efnan had left, Adem was filled with jealousy.
TR_208	35	Adem, who was getting higher and higher and did not believe anything Dilruba said, hurt her with his harsh reaction.
TR_208	36	Witnessing these moments, Aslan could not believe his eyes and informed the duo that Efnan had been arrested.
TR_208	37	Unable to reach Efnan, Aziz made a scene at the police station and beat the police officers.

TR_208	42	Efnan said he did it himself.
TR_208	43	However, Pierre refused to accept Aziz's testimony and blamed Efnan in order to hurt Aziz even more and to inflict the same pain on himself.
TR_208	44	Offering a way out of what had happened, Pierre wanted to take Efnan under his protection, but Efnan preferred to die.
TR_208	45	"""I killed Andre"""
TR_208	46	AZIZ AND EFNAN ARE MARRIED.
TR_208	47	Aziz, who put his own life on the line to save Efnan, confessed in court that he killed Andre, but was told he did it to protect his fiancée.
TR_208	48	Bringing Galip as a witness, Aziz wanted to prove his guilt, but Galip perjured himself by saying that he knew nothing to fix the relationship between him and Pierre.
TR_208	49	The court adjourned for one more day.
TR_208	50	With the help of his police friend, Aziz went to Efnan, who believed she was about to be executed, and dressed her in her white wedding dress.

TR_210	1	Vakıfbank joins the move for inflation-protected deposits
TR_210	2	Following Halkbank, Vakıfbank joined the inflation-protected deposit campaign initiated by Ziraat Bank to ensure that savings are made in Turkish Lira.
TR_210	3	VakıfBank announced the launch of 3 new time deposit products that protect customers' savings from inflation and support TL deposits.
TR_210	4	Following Ziraat and Halkbank, Vakıfbank also launched an inflation-protected deposit product.
TR_210	5	VakıfBank announced the launch of 3 new time deposit products that protect customers' savings from inflation and support TL deposits.
TR_210	6	Ziraat Bank and Halkbank announced on April 22 and April 26, respectively, that they had launched two products that would provide protection against inflation in TL investments.
TR_210	7	ON MAY 1, TAX INCENTIVE CAME.
TR_210	8	On the other hand, tax incentives were introduced for products that aim to encourage savings in Turkish Lira.
TR_210	9	In order to encourage savers to inflation-protected deposits, income tax withholding tax was reduced from 10 percent to zero for deposits with variable interest rates linked to the inflation rate and maturities longer than 1 year.
TR_210	10	Withholding tax rates of 15 percent on demand and notice accounts and accounts with maturities up to 6 months, 12 percent on accounts with maturities up to 1 year, and 10 percent on accounts with maturities longer than 1 year will continue.
TR_210	11	The Presidential Decree will apply to variable time deposit accounts opened as of today.
TR_210	12	VAKIFBANK HAS PREPARED THREE ALTERNATIVES.
TR_210	13	"VakıfBank CEO Mehmet Emin Özcan said, ""Our Inflation-Indexed Earning Accounts, which we have prepared with 3 alternatives, provide inflation assurance for TL deposits."
TR_210	14	Inflation difference is added to the accounts at the end of maturity or at interim periods.
TR_210	15	Our customers' sense of trust is increasing.
TR_210	16	We protect savings with our Inflation-Indexed Earning Account product, which provides high returns on TL deposits.
TR_210	17	With the new products, there will be a rapid return to TL from FX deposit accounts and interest in TL deposits will increase again.
TR_210	18	"This will bring great gains to our country."""
TR_210	19	"According to Vakıfbank's statement, in the first alternative of the ""Inflation-Indexed Earning Account"", which aims to support TL deposit savings, TL deposit accounts to be opened with maturities between 92 and 370 days will be able to receive guaranteed high returns without being affected by inflation."
TR_210	20	At account opening, the interest rate on fixed income time deposits and additional interest rate will be committed.
TR_210	21	At the end of the term, the committed interest rate will be compared with the interest rate calculated by adding the latest annual inflation rate.
TR_210	22	Interest will accrue on the account at the higher interest rate as a result of the comparison.
TR_210	23	Thus, customers will be offered guaranteed high returns on their TL investments and will not be affected by inflation.
TR_210	24	In the event of a withdrawal within the maturity period, the maturity of the account will not be impaired and interest will accrue on the amount in the account at the end of the maturity period.
TR_210	25	"The second alternative of VakıfBank's ""Inflation-Indexed Earning Account"" product will provide TL savers with forward-looking inflation protection rather than interest income. In this deposit account to be opened with a maturity of 366-370 days, there will be no fixed interest rate commitment on the opening date and a risk premium will be committed."
TR_210	26	At the maturity date, the risk premium rate valid on the account opening date will be added to the most recently announced 12-month CPI rate of change.
TR_210	27	Again, during the maturity period, account holders will be able to make transactions from their accounts without deteriorating their maturity.
TR_210	28	In the third alternative, accounts can be opened with maturities of 366-370 days.
TR_210	29	Inflation protection will be provided by adding the risk premium rate valid on the account opening date to the most recently announced CPI change rate. 3-monthly returns will be provided to TL deposit account holders.
TR_210	30	Transactions can also be made from the account on maturity.

TR_232	1	It grows only in 4 provinces!
TR_232	2	They sell it for 4,500 liras per kilo
TR_232	3	Known as 'emperors' tea' in the world and 'white elixir' in Turkey, the harvest period of white tea, which is sold for up to 4,500 TL per kilo, has started.
TR_232	4	Producers entering the garden collect white tea buds.
TR_232	5	The production of white tea started 6 years ago in Rize, Trabzon, Artvin and Giresun in the Eastern Black Sea Region.
TR_232	6	With the practice initiated by the General Directorate of Tea Enterprises (ÇAYKUR), the upper sprouts of tea, known as 'buds', are collected manually by producers.
TR_232	7	The harvest period for white tea, which is bought from the producer for 600 TL per kilogram, has started this year.
TR_232	8	Producers entering the garden harvest the ripening bud shoots.
TR_232	9	4,500 TL PER KILO.
TR_232	10	White tea, known as 'emperors' tea' in the world and 'white elixir' in Turkey with a price of up to 4,500 TL per kilo, is produced in limited quantities.
TR_232	11	Demand for the limited production of white tea cannot be met. White tea, which is offered for sale in 20-gram jars, is especially in demand from abroad.
TR_232	12	Every year, many people from the Middle East and Arab countries as well as Europe place orders for white tea.
TR_232	13	"""500 GRAMS CAN BE COLLECTED DAILY"" Rize Commodity Exchange General Coordinator Hasan Önder, who harvested white tea, stated that the collection scheme is not easy and that an average of 1 person can collect 400-500 grams per day, ""The easy way to collect is to collect 2.5 leaves and sort them at home."

TR_232	15	You can make green tea with the leftovers.
TR_232	16	The collection phase is very difficult but the production phase is easy.
TR_232	17	As we can produce it ourselves, you have the chance to sell it at high prices to companies in the sector. The cost of 1 kilogram of fresh white tea varies between 600 and 700 TL.
TR_232	18	This is a great source of income for our producers.
TR_232	19	"The average kilogram sales price of our white tea this year varies between 4,000 and 4,500 TL."""
TR_232	20	"""IT'S NOT LIKE PICKING FRESH TEA"""

TR_232	22	Difficult to collect.
TR_232	23	When picking, we select the topmost shoots.
TR_232	24	It's not like picking fresh tea.
TR_232	25	It is difficult to pick them because we pick them one by one by hand.
TR_232	26	It is easier to collect normal tea, but the income of white tea is very good. 1 kilo of white tea earns close to 600 TL.

TR_235	2	"Diet and Nutrition Specialist Bengü Ünal said, ""Oilseeds such as hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, which are rich in vitamins and minerals such as omega 3, zinc, magnesium, strengthen the immune system and act as a shield against the flu."""
TR_235	3	Bengü Ünal, Diet and Nutrition Specialist in Manisa, stated that the immune system should be strengthened in these seasons when seasonal changes are experienced and gave information about the foods that strengthen the immune system.
TR_235	4	"Stating that the immune system works non-stop during the day but needs support, Dietitian Bengü Ünal said, ""The immune system is one of the defense systems of our body."
TR_235	5	Although we do not realize it during the day, it works non-stop during the day.
TR_235	6	But it needs our support to become stronger.
TR_235	7	Strengthening the immune system, especially during seasonal transitions, reduces the risk of viral infections.
TR_235	8	"The more we strengthen the immune system, the more we will reduce diseases."""
TR_235	9	"Unal, who warned about paying attention to nutrition in daily life in order to keep the immune system strong, said, ""We need to pay attention to nutrition in our daily lives."
TR_235	10	For this, the day must start with breakfast. 5 meals a day, including 3 main meals and 2 snacks, must be made.
TR_235	11	Meat or chicken should be consumed 3 times a week and fish, a source of omega 3, should be consumed 2 times a week.
TR_235	12	In addition, vegetables should be consumed every day and 3-4 portions of fruit should be consumed.
TR_235	13	Vitamin C, which is the most known and most prominent vitamin that strengthens our immune system in our daily lives, strengthens the immune system in the body by purifying it from toxic elements because it is rich in antioxidants.
TR_235	14	"While these are mostly found in fruits such as tangerines, oranges and lemons, they are also found in green leafy vegetables."""
TR_235	15	"""Oilseeds act as a shield against the flu"""
TR_235	16	"Stating that oil seeds such as hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts strengthen the immune system and act as a shield against the flu, Ünal said, ""Oil seeds such as hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts, which are rich in vitamins and minerals such as omega 3, zinc, magnesium, strengthen the immune system and act as a shield against the flu."
TR_235	17	Pomegranates, as their red color suggests, get this color from the substance anthicyanin.
TR_235	18	The anticyanin substance also strengthens the immune system and helps prevent many diseases from influenza to cancer.

TR_240	1	15:33 'value increase' fraud in citizenship for foreigners prevented
TR_240	2	Until 2018, foreigners wishing to obtain citizenship in Turkey could benefit from this right by investing 1 million dollars in real estate.
TR_240	3	In September 2018, a regulation was introduced and the real estate worth $1 million was reduced to $250,000.
TR_240	4	This regulation also applies to foreigners who invest or bank at least 500 thousand dollars or provide jobs for at least 50 Turkish citizens.
TR_240	5	According to the new regulation, foreigners will be able to buy real estate without paying VAT, while the condition that the real estate cannot be sold before 1 year has been set.
TR_240	6	The reduction of the investment of 1 million dollars to 250 thousand dollars for citizenship had a positive impact on the real estate sector.
TR_240	7	In February 2019, the first year following the regulation, housing sales to foreigners in Turkey increased by 92.1 percent compared to the same period of 2018 and reached 3,321.
TR_240	8	Those who wanted to exploit this situation quickly resorted to cheating.
TR_240	9	Some of the foreigners who wanted to obtain citizenship from Turkey agreed with some appraisers and made sales by showing even immovable properties worth 50-100 thousand dollars at 250 thousand dollars and above.
TR_240	10	AUTOMATION SYSTEM.
TR_240	11	When the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre detected this fraud, it made a second regulation.
TR_240	12	Accordingly, the smart system chooses which appraiser will support the foreign investor who will invest in real estate to obtain citizenship.
TR_240	13	Foreign investors who cannot meet with the appraiser in advance cannot resort to fraud.
TR_240	14	"Explaining that the system prevents cheating, Antalya Land Registry Cadastre 6th Regional Director Funda Aydın Seymen said, ""We have found that there is some misleading information in the valuation reports that come to us. We have witnessed that immovable properties worth less than 250 thousand dollars are shown high just to obtain citizenship."
TR_240	15	We therefore needed to prevent misleading valuation reports.
TR_240	16	"With the system developed, we cut the communication between the foreign investor seeking citizenship and the appraiser."""
TR_240	17	Selman Özgün, a member of the Real Estate Investment Trust Association (GYODER) and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helmann Yapı, said that 71 percent growth was achieved in Antalya in the 9-month period of 2021 compared to the previous year.
TR_240	18	"Stating that 7 thousand 251 houses were sold to foreigners in the city in 9 months, Özgün said that they expect 50 thousand houses to be sold to foreigners in Turkey and 10 thousand houses to be sold to foreigners in Antalya at the end of the year. Stating that the revenue to be obtained from the houses targeted to be sold to foreigners for 2023 is 15 billion dollars, Özgün said, ""We expect it to approach 10 billion dollars by 2021."
TR_240	19	The most houses were sold to Iranians with 5 thousand 923. 5 thousand 621 Iraqis and 3 thousand 115 Russians were the foreigners who bought houses respectively.
TR_240	20	"Western countries stand out in the top 20."""
TR_240	21	MOST IN ANTALYA AFTER ISTANBUL.
TR_240	22	"Selman Özgün, who stated that after Istanbul, most housing sales to foreigners are realized in Antalya, said the following about the trick used by appraisers: ""There has been a problem here for a while."
TR_240	23	Houses were overpriced far above their real value.
TR_240	24	We were witnessing conversations where no such figure was actually taken.
TR_240	25	Transactions are now carried out through the system.

TR_244	4	Kurum summarized the measures to be taken against exorbitant rent increases and the production of housing and land for those who do not own a house:
TR_244	5	DOES NOT WORK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW: Citizens can apply to the courts for increases in rents contrary to the Code of Obligations.
TR_244	6	Our courts cannot take decisions outside of this, because the law is here.
TR_244	7	Our citizens can report illegal increases to us.
TR_244	8	The law defines rent updates every 5 years.
TR_244	9	When we look at the process, it is not working in accordance with the law.
TR_244	10	We will apply the necessary legal sanctions here.
TR_244	11	At this point, our 4 ministries are working on an application that will make our homeowners happy and support our tenants.

TR_244	14	We will stand by both the tenant and the landlord.
TR_244	15	We will not leave citizens helpless in this crisis, even if it is temporary.
TR_244	16	AS IF YOU WERE PAYING THE RENT: In 81 provinces, we will realize this project in provinces where our citizens are in need and where housing price increases are more common.
TR_244	17	Our citizens will be able to own a house with low installments like paying dues.
TR_244	18	We are adding to this project a project that will support our small and medium-sized industrialists in order to increase employment.
TR_244	19	By building small and medium-sized industrial sites, we will pave the way for our citizens to own these enterprises with low down payments and low installments, as in the social housing practice.
TR_244	20	SALE OF TREASURY LANDS: In order to reduce housing prices, we will prepare Treasury-owned lands on the peripheries of cities such as Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir with their infrastructure and prepare them for those who do not own a house to own a house.
TR_244	21	We will ensure that the lands are bought in the long term, at affordable prices, by citizens without houses.
TR_244	22	DRAW BEFORE A NOTARY PUBLIC: Houses cannot be transferred for 5 years.
TR_244	23	The same understanding will be applied to land.
TR_244	24	We will do it in cities where there is a need.
TR_244	25	Those who meet the requirements will apply.
TR_244	26	If the number of applicants is higher than the number of applicants, a lottery will be held before a notary public.
TR_244	27	With the declaration of a reserve area, there will be exemptions from fees and VAT.
TR_244	28	ALLEGATIONS OF LOOTING: They are trying to trick the citizen's mind.

TR_244	30	Where is there any looting of the lower income group except for those who do not own a house?
TR_244	31	If someone is a citizen, a citizen who does not have a house, a citizen from a low-income group, yes, we are lending treasury lands to our citizens so that our citizens from a low-income group can own a house. Table of 6 pursuing an agenda....

TR_246	25	Honestly, it's hard to do such crazy tours anymore.
TR_246	26	We used to play two places on the same day.
TR_246	27	The times we traveled from city to city in the rocking and rolling of the minibus.

TR_246	65	At that moment you are sovereign.
TR_246	66	How you act is in the course of the night.
TR_246	67	There is a refrain, I sing it, I decorate the left and right with different sounds in my mind.
TR_246	68	"Directing the moment of ""all together now"" gives me the taste of being on the stage, I lie to you."
TR_246	69	A choir of five thousand people.
TR_246	70	There is no structure to my movements.
TR_246	71	Whatever I feel at that moment, my body changes shape and form.
TR_246	72	I never had a history of dancing in a disco.
TR_246	73	"It is when you are on that stage and when it comes down to it that they say ""something is happening to me""."
TR_246	74	Fatigue and finale.
TR_246	75	At the end of the concert, after the last salute, the stress of the day gives way to emptiness.
TR_246	76	It was a dream and reality is waiting for you after you step off the stage.
TR_246	77	It's about time they asked for photos and autographs.
TR_246	78	Inevitably, small talk begins.
TR_246	79	It is impossible to describe the exhaustion and the fact that he left everything on that stage.
TR_246	80	Sometimes the finale ends with tripe with lots of garlic in a soup shop.

TR_251	11	WE WERE LEFT ON OUR OWN: Turkey has been left alone in its extraordinary struggle to prevent irregular migration from Syria.
TR_251	12	It is a source of shame on behalf of humanity that the doors closed to the Syrian oppressed are opened wide to the FETO criminals who attempted a coup in our country and shed the blood of 251 of our citizens.
TR_251	13	UNCOMPROMISING ATTITUDE: In the face of this picture, our neighbor Greece has accelerated its maximalist policies instead of making a meaningful contribution to our country's well-intentioned efforts.
TR_251	14	While the refugee crisis could have been an opportunity to strengthen cooperation between the two countries, this historic opportunity was squandered due to Greece's intransigence.
TR_251	15	WE HAVE NEVER BEEN A PARTY TO ESCALATION: As Turkey, we want the Aegean Sea to be characterized by peace and friendship rather than tension and strife.
TR_251	16	With this understanding, we have been careful so far not to be on the side of escalation.
TR_251	17	We have always acted with restraint in the face of tensions-especially in maritime jurisdictions, violations of the non-military status of islands and NAVTEX announcements by our neighbor Greece.
TR_251	18	We have prioritized solving our problems through dialogue and negotiation.
TR_251	19	FAIT ACCOMPLI MUST BE AVOIDED: While defending our legitimate rights arising from history and international law to the end, we have never neglected to open space for diplomacy.
TR_251	20	We maintain this positive attitude today.
TR_251	21	We expect Greece to respect our rights and interests and avoid fait accompli and unilateral actions.
TR_251	22	I believe that we will find solutions with Greece based on fairness, justice, cooperation and neighborly law.
TR_251	23	We want to leave our children a more stable, more peaceful, more secure future instead of a ball of problems.

TR_259	1	Insomnia confession from the beautiful actress: I haven't slept for three weeks!
TR_259	2	"Müjde Uzman wrote in her post about her experiences, ""I hope I have made logical and meaningful sentences because I feel like I am under water or in outer space."
TR_259	3	Naturally...
TR_259	4	Anyway, it will pass, it will pass...
TR_259	5	It's not my first Insomnia, but it was frustrating.
TR_259	6	As if it wasn't already broken enough.
TR_259	7	"I wonder what I should do to continue the day,"" he wrote."
TR_259	8	"In his next post, the actor said, ""Melatonin, meditation, breathing techniques, meditation music, lavender, chamomile, passiflora, getting up early, working, getting tired... Nothing works anymore, I think I am in the third week of the marathon of not sleeping, and today I have seen the peak."
TR_259	9	"I still couldn't sleep, I didn't sleep at all,"" he wrote."
TR_259	10	WHAT IS INSOMNIA?
TR_259	11	Insomnia is the name of a disorder in which it becomes difficult to fall and stay asleep, or to wake up shortly after falling asleep.
TR_259	12	It has been observed that insomnia, one of the most common sleep disorders, turns into a syndrome when it becomes persistent and affects the quality of life badly.
TR_259	13	Sleep problems that persist for a month or more may need to be treated with professional help.
TR_259	14	Low energy needed during the day is one of the biggest problems for people who make insomnia a routine of life and struggle with this disease.
TR_259	15	Because people with insomnia feel weak, tired and exhausted throughout the day from the moment they wake up.
TR_259	16	Another general feeling that comes with lack of sleep is a negative trend in mood.
TR_259	17	People's tendency to think negatively because of their need for sleep can lead to various psychological disorders and loss of the ability to have a clear mind.
TR_259	18	Although there are different causes of insomnia, side effects of medications, periods of trauma, insomnia due to acute illnesses are more common.
TR_259	19	A professional examination and diagnostic process is required to diagnose insomnia, which is a condition that develops due to a certain period in human life, an event or physical illness, such as sleep deprivation, inability to fall asleep, sleep interruptions.
TR_259	20	Not every insomnia or periodic sleep problems can be defined as chronic insomnia.
TR_259	21	For this, the disease must be diagnosed by a specialist in the field.
TR_259	22	WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA?
TR_259	23	Not all of the symptoms of insomnia can be seen together in every disease process.
TR_259	24	However, individuals who show one or more of these symptoms for a long time and who cannot overcome the problem of insomnia may need to apply to the relevant units in order to receive expert opinion and, if necessary, treatment.
TR_259	25	A few of the common symptoms of insomnia can be listed as follows: - Problems falling asleep at night - Consistently interrupted deep sleep - Waking up too early in the morning - Insomnia-related anxiety - Attention problems, poor memory - Feeling sleepy during the day - Developing internal worries about sleeping One of the most obvious consequences of insomnia is that it involves a cycle based on bodily signals.
TR_259	26	For people who are deprived of adequate sleep for long periods of time, sleep deprivation brings many physical and mental reactions such as headaches, confusion, and problems focusing.
TR_263	1	Is it ethical to sell information or not
TR_263	2	Being a scientist starts with asking the right question and defining the problem.
TR_263	3	The scientific knowledge produced in solving these problems becomes a sine qua non of academic life.
TR_263	4	The solution of the idea put forward as a problem in the knowledge production process is carried out within a project.
TR_263	5	In other words, a scientist working at a university or research center needs funding to solve the problem.
TR_263	6	This is financed by funds allocated from the public budget.
TR_263	7	How much resources are allocated to the scientific research projects units of universities, TUBITAK or Public Strategy units in the process of scientific knowledge production is also the most important criterion of whether scientific projects will be realized or not.
TR_263	8	"Most of this funding comes from ""taxes collected from employees""."
TR_263	9	In other words, VAT, invoices, etc. collected from laborers, pensioners, etc. fund the projects of scientists.
TR_263	10	IF THE PUBLIC IS THE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE KNOWLEDGE PRODUCED, WHY SHOULD THE PUBLIC PAY FOR A SCIENTIFIC OPINION TO BE PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC?
TR_263	11	The reason for making this statement is to identify the source of the financing problem in solving the issues that scientists see as problems and to examine whether it is right to charge a fee or to pay for the information provided while sharing the information they produce with the society by using public resources.
TR_263	12	If not enough resources are allocated for scientific projects, unsolved problems will remain unresolved and many people will be victimized or may lose their lives because of that problem.
TR_263	13	Imagine; if the budget is not allocated for research on cancer, deaths due to cancer will continue, or if the budget is not allocated for the identification of faults in earthquake preparedness, earthquakes will always remain a problem.
TR_263	14	When funding is allocated to science, scientists share their scientific knowledge and results by writing articles in scientific journals, publishing books or attending congresses and presenting them to other researchers.
TR_263	15	However, this sharing process can also be done by presenting a scientific opinion or participating in a TV program to meet the needs of society in general.
TR_263	16	Why is the sharing of scientific knowledge produced at universities with public resources in public forums included among the revolving fund services of university administrations and priced?
TR_263	17	In other words, why do the boards of directors of universities turn the knowledge produced with public resources into a commercial commodity and turn the process of providing opinions, which is considered a public duty, into a means of earning profit as a price.
TR_263	18	HOW ETHICAL IS IT TO SELL INFORMATION?
TR_263	19	I thought about it all the time I was working at the University?
TR_263	20	Why does my university ask me to provide information for a fee when I go on a TV program?
TR_263	21	because.
TR_263	22	How ethical is this situation?
TR_263	23	Why is the process of public knowledge production monetized in its output?
TR_263	24	In other words, what will the fee for submitting an opinion bring?
TR_263	25	In other words, the person who produces with public resources will receive revolving fund income from the opinion he/she offers in addition to the salary he/she receives, and the other part of the remaining amount will be shared among administrative staff within the university (dean, rector, according to revolving capital sharing procedures, etc.).
TR_263	26	What is shared?
TR_263	27	It will manifest itself in the form of the prohibition of the public's right to information by selling the information produced with the people's taxes for a price, and if the price is not paid, the public's right to information will be prohibited.
TR_263	28	So if a scientist cannot pay for a TV program, the public's right to information will be denied.
TR_263	29	And it will be the people who will be punished!
TR_263	30	IS ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY-CERRAHPAŞA THE ONLY UNIVERSITY THAT OFFERS SERVICES FOR A FEE?
TR_263	31	When you look at the web page* of Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, you will see that with the decision taken by the Board of Directors on 30.01.2020, the services given in the table above are priced for a fee.
TR_263	32	So, when I examined what is priced or put forward as a service (if it is a public service, why does it have an economic price), I first tried to understand the logic behind this pricing.
TR_263	33	When you try to understand why there are differences in the pricing of scientific opinions according to academic titles, how will you explain this to yourself?
TR_263	34	"When a ""Dr. faculty member"" produces and presents a solution to a more pressing problem than another Prof. Dr. faculty member at the same university, why is his/her opinion scaled with a commodity, and why is it priced lower/higher?"
TR_263	35	What is the logic of this?
TR_263	36	Or in a seminar, a lecturer, Assoc.
TR_263	37	What will he/she be talking about that will cost less than a colleague with the title of Dr.?
TR_263	38	There is a university executive board decision that puts the equality of scientific knowledge into question, as well as its price.
TR_263	39	Or what can a scientist with the title of Prof. Dr. write more/less than a colleague with the title of Dr. Lecturer when translating?
TR_263	40	"My humble suggestion to the board members who manage the universities of my beautiful country; ""stop seeing knowledge as a commodity!""."
TR_263	41	Don't reduce the public's right to information, including scientific opinion or TV programs, to a commodity that can be paid for using publicly funded funds!
TR_263	42	Give up the power of money in this university-capital relationship.
TR_263	43	Support all faculty members with public funds and discourage scientists from solving society's problems for money.
TR_263	44	In this way, you direct the academic titles of faculty members not to serve private enterprise, but to solve society's problems free of charge.
TR_263	45	If the managers of institutions have to pay a price, let them pay this price to the one who solves the problems of the society the most.
TR_263	46	This price should not be in money.
TR_263	47	As long as everything is reduced to money, neither the knowledge produced nor the service provided will be of real value.
TR_263	48	"Because there will definitely be academics who claim that they will solve every problem that will be encountered for a price, ""like the Canal Istanbul project""."
TR_263	49	In return for that price, it will surely produce a solution for you.
TR_263	50	But will that solution be the real solution?
TR_263	51	you think about it!

TR_290	1	Turkish company is expanding to the world: 30 facilities on 3 continents
TR_290	2	According to the statement made by Tosyalı Holding, Tosyalı Holding, which ranked 82nd among the world steel producers in 2020 according to the World Steel Producers Association data, continues its 4th stage investments in Algeria uninterruptedly.
TR_290	3	Fatih Dönmez, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources of the Republic of Turkey, and the accompanying delegation visited Algeria for the Turkey-Algeria roundtable on cooperation in the fields of Energy and Mining organized within the scope of the 11th Meeting of the Turkey-Algeria Joint Economic Commission (JEC) and made inspections at Tosyalı Algerie facilities.
TR_290	4	"Fuat Tosyalı, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tosyalı Holding, stated that Tosyalı Algerie, the company's first investment abroad, is the largest private sector investment in Algeria, which is the basis of all global achievements of Tosyalı Holding, and added: ""Today, our Tosyalı Algerie facilities, which are the largest exporter and one of the strongest employers in the country in non-hydro-carbon sectors, are one of the leading integrated facilities not only in Africa but also in Europe in terms of the use of high technology and one of the most efficient production facilities in the world in terms of energy use."
TR_290	5	However, as Tosyalı Holding, we do not only focus on economic investments in the countries we visit.
TR_290	6	For every country we visit, we strive to create values specific to that geography.
TR_290	7	"As a corporation, we make transparent investments and always prioritize contributing to the country's economy."""
TR_290	8	Emphasizing that as Tosyalı, creating qualified employment in the geographies where they operate is their priority, Tosyalı said
TR_290	9	"""Since the day we started our operations, we have increased our local human resources in Algeria by 10 times, and we will continue to increase this ratio through our collaborations with universities."
TR_290	10	Another important topic in cooperation between countries is the clustering that will be created through the ecosystem effect and technology transfer.
TR_290	11	With this understanding, after we started investing in Algeria as Tosyalı, nearly 1000 local and foreign companies became the links of this chain together with us.
TR_290	12	I remember as if it was yesterday, at that time there were an average of 3 flights a week to Algeria from Turkey, but before the pandemic this number had risen to over 50.
TR_290	13	This shows that every investment that is planned and built with a true spirit of cooperation creates a strong and sustainable ecosystem in the country.
TR_290	14	I believe that the strong cooperation between Algeria and Turkey will also create significant opportunities for energy trade.
TR_290	15	"In this respect, Algeria offers opportunities for Turkey to diversify its energy imports."""
TR_290	16	-TOSYALI ALGERIE IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INTEGRATED STEEL PLANTS.
TR_290	17	Thanks to its (DRI) technology, Tosyalı Algerie is among the plants producing the world's greenest and most environmentally friendly steel.
TR_290	18	The first phase of Tosyalı Algerie, the foundations of which were laid in 2011, was completed in 2013, the second phase in 2015 and the third phase in 2018.
TR_290	19	Tosyalı Algerie, which houses the world's largest DRI production facilities with an annual capacity of 2.5 million tons and the world's largest arc furnace powered by DRI, broke a world record by reaching a production figure of 2.23 million tons in 2020.
TR_290	20	Tosyalı Algerie, whose fourth stage investment is ongoing, will transform into an industrial facility with a capacity of 8.5 million tons of flat and long products, 7.5 million tons of which will come from the integrated mining facility, when all stages are completed.
TR_290	21	-INVESTMENT IN THE LARGEST PORT IN ALGERIA.
TR_290	22	Tosyalı Holding, a group with international know-how in the management and operation of industrial and industrial zones, continues its investments in port management.
TR_290	23	In addition to the existing port operation in Iskenderun and the planned port investment in Erzin in Turkey, Tosyalı also has a large port investment in Algeria.
TR_290	24	In Algeria, Tosyalı operates the largest port in the country, where even ships of 200 thousand DWT can dock.
TR_290	25	Thanks to the 12 km conveyor belt system, which is one of the longest lines in Europe, 4 thousand tons per hour can be transported from the port to the factory without using any vehicles.
TR_292	1	When should Fitrah be given?
TR_292	2	When is the last time Fitrah is given?
TR_292	3	Fitrah is a financial act of worship that Muslims are obliged to fulfill for themselves and their dependents when they reach Eid al-Fitr.
TR_292	4	With Eid al-Fitr just around the corner, Muslims who have not yet given the sadaqah al-fitr are questioning when it should be given.
TR_292	5	So when should Fitrah be given?
TR_292	6	When is the last time Fitrah is given?
TR_292	7	Here is the Diyanet's statement on the subject WHAT IS FITIR Sadaqah AND WHEN IS IT GIVEN?
TR_292	8	The sadaqah al-fitr, popularly known as fitrah, is a sadaqah that is obligatory for a Muslim who is religiously rich and reaches the end of the month of Ramadan to give to certain people as a thankfulness for being created as a human being and for fasting the Ramadan fast and reaching Eid.
TR_292	9	Its obligatory nature is established by the Sunnah.
TR_292	10	A person is obliged to pay Fitr for himself and his minor children.
TR_292	11	The Prophet stated that Fitrah is required for every Muslim, slave or free, big or small, male or female.
TR_292	12	It is obligatory on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, but it can also be given before Eid.
TR_292	13	This is even more virtuous.
TR_292	14	However, it can also be given on the day of Eid or later.
TR_292	15	However, it is considered mustahabb to give it before the Eid prayer.
TR_292	16	In the Shafi'i madhhab, it is forbidden to pay Fitrah after sunset on the first day of Eid unless there is a legitimate excuse.
TR_292	17	It is also permissible to give Fitrah in the first days of Ramadan.
TR_292	18	The purpose of Fitrah is to provide a poor person with one day's food according to the standard of living of the society in which he or she lives, thus contributing to his or her participation in the joy of Eid.
TR_292	19	Nowadays, it is more appropriate to determine the amount of al-fitr alms based on the amount that would cover a person's normal food needs for one day (two meals).
TR_292	20	A person cannot give sadaqa al-fitr to those who are considered rich in religion, his parents (parents, grandparents, grandparents), his children (children and grandchildren) and his spouse.
TR_292	21	Fitr can be given to one poor person or it can be distributed to several poor people.
TR_292	22	However, the amount given to one person should not be less than one fitrah.
TR_292	23	WHEN IS THE DEADLINE FOR GIVING RANSOM?
TR_292	24	Fitrah is obligatory on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, but it can also be given before Eid.
TR_292	25	This is even more virtuous.
TR_292	26	However, it can also be given on the day of Eid or later.
TR_292	27	However, it is considered mustahabb to give it before the Eid prayer.
TR_292	28	WHO IS ALLOWED TO PAY THE RANSOM AND WHO IS NOT?
TR_292	29	It is essential that the person who has to give the alms of al-fitr and fasting ransom should not benefit from them directly or indirectly.
TR_292	30	The same rule applies to zakat.
TR_292	31	For this reason, a person cannot give zakat, al-fitr al-sadaqah and ransom to his usūl (descendants) and furu (descendants).
TR_292	32	Usūl means one's mother, father, grandparents and great-grandparents, and furu means one's children, grandchildren and their children.
TR_292	33	Similarly, a person cannot give zakat, fitrah and ransom to his wife, nor can she give them to her husband.
TR_292	34	Other relatives such as siblings, aunts, uncles, uncles, aunts and their children, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law can be given zakat, fitrah and ransom if they are not rich (Zaylaî, Tabyîn, I, 301).
TR_293	1	Pakdemirli: We will be exporting red meat in 2-3 years
TR_293	2	"Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Bekir Pakdemirli said, ""Turkey, thank God, is exporting both fish and poultry as of today."
TR_293	3	I hope we will be able to export red meat within 2-3 years.
TR_293	4	"There is a need for some time here."" In his speech at the opening of the Agriculture and Forestry Sector Meeting held at the meeting hall of the Southeastern Anatolia Exporters' Associations (GAİB), Pakdemirli said that with the transition from the parliamentary system to the Presidential Government System, the people gave them a visa until 2023."
TR_293	5	Stating that efforts are being made to provide better service to the public with the new system, Pakdemirli reminded that after he was appointed as minister, he decided that he would go to the feet of farmers, producers and villagers and try to identify the problems and solutions.
TR_293	6	"Explaining that he is aware of all the problems and that all problems are common, Pakdemirli said: ""We took a very good picture of the problems."
TR_293	7	Know that our hand is on your problems.
TR_293	8	Your problems are our problems.
TR_293	9	We need to increase production by 50 percent in the next 20-25 years.
TR_293	10	Everyone is aware of this.
TR_293	11	So we need to create conditions that will satisfy you.
TR_293	12	We may have problems for a temporary period.
TR_293	13	Compared to last year, your fertilizer increased by 60 percent and your feed by 40 percent.
TR_293	14	We are aware of all this.
TR_293	15	On the other hand, we are also calculating how to reflect these in the prices of wheat and barley you will sell, and how we can be advantageous in terms of price.
TR_293	16	We know them all, we will solve them all.
TR_293	17	Give us some time.
TR_293	18	There are two things in agriculture.
TR_293	19	There are problems that can be solved immediately and others that need time.
TR_293	20	Turkey, thank God, is now exporting both fish and poultry.
